In this exercise, you will use [Problets](http://problets.org/user/f21/) to practice each programming concept we learn in class. 

## Installing Open Web Start

You can install this program from [openwebstart.com](https://openwebstart.com/), by clicking "Downloads" and selecting the appropriate installer for your operating system.  Double click the program to install it once it downloads.  This only needs to be done the first time you use Problets!

## Run Problets and Epplets

To use Problets, right click and choose "Save As" to download [this application](http://problets.org/user/f21/ursinus.jnlp).  If you receive a warning from your browser, you can select the "Keep" option (or "Download Anyway") to download the file.  

Right click on the `ursinus.jnlp` file in your `Downloads` directory, and choose `Open With`.  Select "OpenWebStart" from the list of applications (if it is a folder, click on it, and select "OpenWebStart" inside of that).  Check the box that says "Always" to run this by default.  This way, you can simply double click on the `ursinus.jnlp` file next time.

Once this is set to the default, you can double click on `ursinus.jnlp` in the future to run it.  You will be prompted for your name and email address.  Click on the appropriate exercise to complete the practice.  

## About Problets and Epplets

Problets and Epplets are self-paced exercises that generate problems for you to solve.  It will guide you if you make a mistake, and generate more problems for you to solve until you become proficient.  If a particular topic is easy for you, the system will only generate a few problems for that lesson (and that's OK!).  

With Problets, you will drag and drop using the mouse to work through various exercises.  Using Epplets, you will be presented with code fragments or other information that you can drag and order (for example, placing code statements into the right order to form a program).  These are intended to be fun, brief puzzles that reinforce your background reading assignments to help prepare you for class.

## Submitting Your Work
When you are finished, you will be presented with a "thank you page" that includes a code that looks something like `AAAA-BBBB-CCCC-DDDD`.  **Write down this code.**  On the assignment submission page, you can type in or paste this code.  This will allow me to see that you finished the exercise.
