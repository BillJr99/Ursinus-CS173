  points: 3
  instructions: "Modify the Driver.java file to solve the 3x+1 problem using a loop and conditional."
  goals:
    - To use iteration to compute a discrete value
    - To use conditionals to make choices during each loop iteration

## Trivia

This problem is part of the [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) which suggests that any value will eventually converge back to 1 after a finite number of iterations.  *We don't know if this is true!*
