excerpt: "CS173: Intro to Computer Science - Introduction to to Boolean Expressions"

info:
  points: 3
  instructions: "Modify the Driver.java file to determine if the circumference of a circle is approximately equal to a floating point value."
  goals:
    - To become familiar with the basic structure of a Java program
    - To write a Java statement
    - To declare a variable
    - To manipulate a variable with arithmetic statements
    - To write a compound boolean expression to verify a numeric range
    - To check the value of an imprecise floating point value
    - To explain that a floating point value is represented imprecisely with a discrete binary representation
