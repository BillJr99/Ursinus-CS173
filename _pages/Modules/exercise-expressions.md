  instructions: "Modify the Driver.java file to compute and print the Energy of an object given its mass and the constant c (which is given to you in the program)."
  goals:
    - To become familiar with the basic structure of a Java program
    - To write a Java statement
    - To declare a variable
    - To manipulate a variable with arithmetic statements

                    speed of light = 300000000,

                    meaning "three times ten to the eighth" */

                            of an object, and assign it the 
                            value 2.3.  Be sure to use the 
                            appropriate data type!
                         2. Compute the Energy (using 
                            Einstein's formula: E = MC^2)

                            letter: variables are case 
                            sensitive, so you'll want to 
                            refer to it as C and not c in 
                            this program.
                         3. Print the value using 
                            System.out.println()
