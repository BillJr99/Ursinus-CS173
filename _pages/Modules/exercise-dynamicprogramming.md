  instructions: "Your job below is to change the fib method so that it checks to see if a particular Fibonacci number has been saved in memory before trying to compute it. If it's already been saved, simply return what's in memory."
  goals:
    - To improve performance of a recursive algorithm by cacheing values via a Dynamic Program

In this exercise \[[^1]\], the main method computes `fib(20)` and `fib(30)`, and by default, it outputs the following stats:

* `fib(20) = 10946, counts = 21891`
* `fib(30) = 1346269, counts = 2692537`

But once you start using the memory properly, you'll get these stats instead, which are way more efficient

* `fib(20) = 10946, counts = 39`
* `fib(30) = 1346269, counts = 21`

In fact, now computing `fib(30)` takes even fewer than the 30 steps we would have done by hand, because we remembered some of the steps we did when computing `fib(20)` right before that.

## Hints

* Recall that to see if a key is in a HashMap `map`, you say `map.containsKey(key)`, which returns `true` if the key is in the map and `false` otherwise. So you'd want to check the memory by saying something like `fibMem.containsKey(N)`. You should use the result of this in an if statement
* Recall that to retrieve values from the hash map, you use the `get(key)` method.
