title: "CS173: Intro to Computer Science - Nearest Value in an Array without Going Over"
excerpt: "CS173: Intro to Computer Science - Nearest Value in an Array without Going Over"

info:
  points: 3
  instructions: "Modify the Driver.java file to find the nearest value to a given value in an array, that is less than or equal to that value."
  goals:
    - To iterate over an array
    - To conditionally identify a specific array element by its index
