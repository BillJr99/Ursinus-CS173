In this exercise, you will fill in a function to determine the winner of a game of Four-in-a-Row.  A game board (a 2D array of `int`s) initially contains all `0`s.  Each player (team 1 and 2) places a value into a column of the game board, and it falls to the bottom of the board.  The game ends with a winner if the board contains four consecutive items down a column (only the vertical column - you don't need to worry about the rows or diagonals).  For example, this board represents a game won by team 2:

```java
int[][] board = new int[][] {
    { 0, 2, 2, 0 },
    { 0, 2, 1, 1 },
    { 0, 2, 1, 1 },
    { 0, 2, 1, 1 }
};     
```
