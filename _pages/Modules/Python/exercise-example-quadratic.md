  points: 3
  instructions: "Write a function that computes one of the roots of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation\">quadratic equation</a>.  In addition to multiplying b by itself, you can compute <code>b*b</code> using the <code>b**</code> with the <code>**</code> operator.  The <code>math.sqrt()</code> method takes a single parameter, which is the number whose root should be computed, and returns the result.  Now complete the code to compute one of the roots of the quadratic formula"
  goals:
    - To write mathematical expressions in Python
    - To write a function that computes an expression and returns its result

## Quadratic Formula

For reference, the quadratic formula is:

<span>\\[\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{(b^{2} - 4ac)}}{2a}\\]</span>

given an equation:

<span>\\[ax^{2} + bx + c = 0\\]</span>

In this exercise, you can simply compute one of the roots, as follows:

<span>\\[\frac{-b + \sqrt{(b^{2} - 4ac)}}{2a}\\]</span>
