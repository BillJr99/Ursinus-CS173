excerpt: "CS173: Intro to Computer Science - Functions"

info:
  points: 3
  instructions: "Write a function that computes one of the roots of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation\">quadratic equation</a>.  In addition to multiplying b by itself, you can compute <code>b*b</code> using the <code>Math.pow()</code> method.  The <code>Math.sqrt()</code> method takes a <code>double</code> parameter, which is the number whose root should be computed, and returns the result as a <code>double</code>.  Now write a program that calls a method that you will write to compute the quadratic root, and then have <code>main()</code> print the root that you calculate."
  goals:
    - To write mathematical expressions in Java
    - To write a function that computes an expression and returns its result
    - To call a function from <code>main()</code> and use its return value

## Quadratic Formula

For reference, the quadratic formula is:

<span>\\[\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{(b^{2} - 4ac)}}{2a}\\]</span>

given an equation:

<span>\\[ax^{2} + bx + c = 0\\]</span>

In this exercise, you can simply compute one of the roots, as follows:

<span>\\[\frac{-b + \sqrt{(b^{2} - 4ac)}}{2a}\\]</span>
