  goals: 
    - To be able to write an <code>if</code> statement
    - To be able to write an <code>else</code> statement
    - To design boolean expressions for conditionals
    - To combine the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks to form conditionals that utilize the <code>else if</code> construct
    - To implement complex conditional statements using boolean expression operators

      questions:
        - "Make up a 3-way <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram\">Venn Diagram</a> of your choosing; you can look one up on the Internet if you wish."
        - "Label the three large circles \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\".  In each of the 7 regions within the Venn Diagram, which elements are true and which are false?"
        - "Write a series of <code>if</code> statements that may use <code>else</code> and <code>else if</code> blocks that print out the different states of your Venn Diagram.  There are a few ways to go about this, so we will discuss and compare approaches as a class."
