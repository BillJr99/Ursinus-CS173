      questions:
        - How would you describe a 2D array in terms of usual 1D arrays?
        - Run this code in the <a href=https://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/java_visualize/#mode=edit>Java Visualizer</a>.  What is the output?
        - Re-draw the arrays <code>mat1</code> and <code>mat2</code> as a square grid. 
        - Is it possible to re-size these arrays if you need to add additional elements later?  If so, how, and if not, why not?
        - "Develop pseudocode to determine whether a 2D array is a &quot;magic array&quot;, in which the sum of each column and row of a square array is the same value.  A sample 3x3 magic array is: <code>[ 4, 9, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 1, 6 ]</code>."

      title: Loops with 2D Arrays
         
  reflective_prompts:
    - How would you modify the above program to assign values to <code>mat1</code>, and then to multiply the two matrices together?  To multiply matrices, each cell of the result is equal to the products of each element of the corresponding column of <code>mat1</code> with each element of the corresponding row of <code>mat2</code>, added together.  A triply-nested loop with a sum is required.
