excerpt: "CS173: Intro to Computer Science - Conditionals"

info:
  goals: 
    - To be able to write an <code>if</code> statement
    - To be able to write an <code>else</code> statement
    - To design boolean expressions for conditionals
    - To combine the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks to form conditionals that utilize the <code>else if</code> construct
    - To implement complex conditional statements using boolean expression operators

      questions:
        - Modify the above program to return a boolean that is true if a person can run for president, and false otherwise

      title: Creating a Waterfall of Possibilities by combining <code>else</code> and <code>if</code>
      questions:
        - Which code structure (<code>canRunForPresident</code> or <code>canRunForPresident2</code>) do you prefer and why?

      title: "Compound <code>if</code> conditionals"
      questions: 
        - What text should go into the <code>println</code> statement to indicate whether the person can vote (at least age 18) but also is too young to run for president (at least age 35)?
        - Suppose we wished to <code>return</code> a <code>boolean</code> to <code>main()</code> indicating whether a person is old enough to vote but not old enough to run for President.  What modifications to the above code are needed?
        - "Consider the letter grade breakdown table on our <a href=\"../#grading\">course syllabus</a>.  Write a series of compound <code>if</code> statements that determines if your grade is an A+, an A, or an A-."

      questions:
        - "Make up a 3-way <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram\">Venn Diagram</a> of your choosing; you can look one up on the Internet if you wish."
        - "Label the three large circles \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\".  In each of the 7 regions within the Venn Diagram, which elements are true and which are false?"
        - "Write a series of <code>if</code> statements that may use <code>else</code> and <code>else if</code> blocks that print out the different states of your Venn Diagram.  There are a few ways to go about this, so we will discuss and compare approaches as a class."
