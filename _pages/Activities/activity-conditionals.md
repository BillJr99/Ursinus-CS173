  goals: 
    - To be able to write an <code>if</code> statement
    - To be able to write an <code>else</code> statement
    - To design boolean expressions for conditionals
    - To implement complex conditional statements using boolean expression operators

      title: Conditionals for Selective Execution with <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> Statements        
      questions:
        - Write and execute an <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statement that determines if it is warm and not raining outside, and prints out whether or not it is appropriate to go outside.
