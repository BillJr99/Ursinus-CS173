    - To be able to inherit from a superclass.
    - To be able to override a method from a superclass.
    - To be able to call <code>super()</code> in a constructor or method.
    - To be able to explain the difference between an interface, an abstract class, and a superclass.
    - To be able to inherit protected methods or fields from a superclass.

      title: Inheritance Relationship
      questions:
        - Which items in the model are &quot;Vehicles?&quot;  Which are &quot;Homes?&quot;
        - What kinds of things do a car, truck, and motor home have in common?  What kinds of things do a motor home, townhouse, and apartment have in common?

      title: Interfaces
      questions:
        - Does an <code>interface</code> define fields, methods, both, or neither?
        - What is the advantage of defining an <code>interface</code>?
        - When using an <code>interface</code>, it is sometimes still necessary to duplicate code.  Can you find an example of this in this Model?
        - Run this example in <a href=https://repl.it>repl.it</a>.  What must each file be named, and what code goes into which file?  When you click Run, what <code>javac</code> command executes (specifically, what files are compiled)?

      title: Inheriting from a Superclass, Abstract Methods, and <code>super()</code>
      questions:
        - How did each file change above by converting the <code>Vehicle</code> interface to a class?
        - By converting the <code>Vehicle</code> interface to a class, what can we now define in a <code>Vehicle</code> that we could not define in the <code>interface</code>?
        - You can implement an <code>interface</code>; what is the keyword to subclass a class?
        - From context, what do you think the abstract keyword means in the <code>Vehicle</code> class?
        - From context, what do you think the call to <code>super()</code> does?
        - Notice that some elements are scoped to be <code>public</code> and <code>private</code>, like before, but now some items are <code>protected</code>.  Which items are <code>protected</code>, and in which files do they reside?  What do you think this scope allows/disallows?
