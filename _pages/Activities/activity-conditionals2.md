excerpt: "CS173: Intro to Computer Science - Conditionals"

info:
  prev: ./Conditionals
  next: ./Conditionals3
  
  goals: 
    - To be able to write an <code>if</code> statement
    - To be able to write an <code>else</code> statement
    - To design boolean expressions for conditionals
    - To combine the <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> blocks to form conditionals that utilize the <code>else if</code> construct
    - To implement complex conditional statements using boolean expression operators

      title: Creating a Waterfall of Possibilities by combining <code>else</code> and <code>if</code>
      questions:
        - Which code structure (<code>canRunForPresident</code> or <code>canRunForPresident2</code>) do you prefer and why?

      title: "Compound <code>if</code> conditionals"
      questions: 
        - What text should go into the <code>println</code> statement to indicate whether the person can vote (at least age 18) but also is too young to run for president (at least age 35)?
        - "Consider the letter grade breakdown table on our <a href=\"../#grading\">course syllabus</a>.  Write a series of compound <code>if</code> statements that determines if your grade is an A+, an A, or an A-."
