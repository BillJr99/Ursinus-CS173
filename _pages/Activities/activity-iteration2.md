  goals: 
    - To be able to explain the uses of the <code>while</code> loop structure 
    - To be able to explain the uses of the <code>do</code> loop structure 
    - To be able to apply boolean expressions to iterative structures via the <code>while</code> loop
    - To be able to apply boolean expressions to iterative structures via the <code>do</code> loop

      title: The <code>while</code> Loop
      questions:
        - Modify this code to implement a <code>checkIfRaining()</code> function that generates a random number between 1 and 10, and returns <code>true</code> if the number is greater than 7 (and return <code>false</code> otherwise).

      title: The <code>while</code> Loop with User Input
      questions: 
        - "Why isn’t the code example from the first model written as a <code>do</code> loop?  How might this result in telling someone to \"play outside\" while it is raining?"
