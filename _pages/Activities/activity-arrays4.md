  goals: 
    - To be able to create, access, and iterate an ArrayList
    - To be able to explain that an ArrayList is a dynamic array that allows for expansion at runtime
    - To be able to dynamically grow and shrink an ArrayList
    - To use objects such as the <code>ArrayList</code> that accept templated/generic data types

      title: The <code>ArrayList</code>
      questions:      
        - What is the purpose of the <code>&lt;String&gt;</code> notation when creating the <code>ArrayList</code>?
        - What would be the effect of creating an <code>ArrayList</code> that stored another <code>ArrayList</code>?
        - What is the size of the <code>ArrayList</code> prior to calling <code>remove()</code>?  What is the size after the call?
        - Suppose a friend needed to remove every other element from an <code>ArrayList</code> (say, the ones with an even numbered index).  Looping for <code>i = 0</code> to <code>arr.size()</code>, they remove each element if <code>(i % 2 == 0)</code> but the wrong elements seem to be removed.  What happened, and what can we do instead?
