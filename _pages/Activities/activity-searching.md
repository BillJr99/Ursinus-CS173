  goals: 
    - To explain the role of an algorithm in computing
    - To design an algorithm without the use of a computer
        
  models:
    - model: |
        Arrange yourselves in a line, and on a piece of paper, write down a whole number between 1 and N.       
      title: Algorithms
      questions:
        - Designate someone to go around the room, asking people what their number is.  Write down how many steps that person needs, and what information they have at any given time.  At each step, you can ask one person what their number is, and then you can ask if that is your number.
        - How many steps did it take to find someone with the number you guessed?
        - How many people are in the room?  How might the number of steps change if you had room with more people in it?
    - model: |
        Arrange yourselves in a line, and on a piece of paper, write down a whole number between 1 and N.  This time, arrange yourselves in increasing order by the number you've written down.  This time, you can ask someone what their number is, and if their number is larger or smaller than the one you have.
      title: Algorithmic Efficiency
      questions:
        - How many steps did it take to find someone with the number you guessed this time?
        - How many people are in the room?  How might the number of steps change if you had room with more people in it?
        - Why is this approach better?
        - What are the limitations of using this approach?
