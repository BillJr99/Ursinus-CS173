  goals: 
    - To be able to explain that an array is an ordered collection of data, whether they be primitives or objects.
    - To be able to create an array and assign its elements
    - To be able to access an element from an array by its index
    - To be able to iterate over an array
    - To be able to create, access, and iterate a 2D array
    - To be able to create, access, and iterate an ArrayList
    - To be able to explain that an ArrayList is a dynamic array that allows for expansion at runtime
    - To be able to dynamically grow and shrink an ArrayList
    - To use objects such as the <code>ArrayList</code> that accept templated/generic data types

  models:
    - model: |
        Recall from our earlier examples that we had to create a separate Book object variable for each Book we wanted to create.  We can simplify things by creating a single variable that refers to the whole collection.  This is called an array.  They allow us to leverage loops to quickly iterate over a collection of values or objects.

      title: Creating and Accessing Arrays
      questions:
        - What is the size of the <code>books</code> array?
        - What are the indices of the <code>books</code> array?
        - Why does the array use <code>.length</code>, when a String uses <code>.length()</code>, to report its size?
        - What is the advantage of allocating an array in a loop, when the book titles may need to be set individually?

      title: Iterating Over Arrays
      questions:
        - "How would you modify the program above to play a game of &quot;Duck-Duck-Goose&quot; -- that is, iterating through the array until a certain value is reached (say, <code>10</code>)?"

      questions:
        - How would you describe a 2D array in terms of usual 1D arrays?
        - Run this code in the <a href=https://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/java_visualize/#mode=edit>Java Visualizer</a>.  What is the output?
        - Re-draw the arrays <code>mat1</code> and <code>mat2</code> as a square grid. 
        - Is it possible to re-size these arrays if you need to add additional elements later?  If so, how, and if not, why not?
        - "Develop pseudocode to determine whether a 2D array is a &quot;magic array&quot;, in which the sum of each column and row of a square array is the same value.  A sample 3x3 magic array is: <code>[ 4, 9, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 1, 6 ]</code>."

      title: The <code>ArrayList</code>
      questions:      
        - What is the purpose of the <code>&lt;String&gt;</code> notation when creating the <code>ArrayList</code>?
        - What would be the effect of creating an <code>ArrayList</code> that stored another <code>ArrayList</code>?
        - What is the size of the <code>ArrayList</code> prior to calling <code>remove()</code>?  What is the size after the call?
        - Suppose a friend needed to remove every other element from an <code>ArrayList</code> (say, the ones with an even numbered index).  Looping for <code>i = 0</code> to <code>arr.size()</code>, they remove each element if <code>(i % 2 == 0)</code> but the wrong elements seem to be removed.  What happened, and what can we do instead?

      title: Loops with 2D Arrays
         
  reflective_prompts:
    - How would you modify the above program to assign values to <code>mat1</code>, and then to multiply the two matrices together?  To multiply matrices, each cell of the result is equal to the products of each element of the corresponding column of <code>mat1</code> with each element of the corresponding row of <code>mat2</code>, added together.  A triply-nested loop with a sum is required.
