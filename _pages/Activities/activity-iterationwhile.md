excerpt: "CS173: Intro to Computer Science - Iteration with the while Loop"

info:
  goals: 
    - To be able to explain the uses of the <code>while</code> loop structure 
    - To be able to apply boolean expressions to iterative structures via the <code>while</code> loop

      title: The <code>while</code> Loop
      questions:
        - "Draw a flow chart diagram as you did with the <code>if</code> statement in a <a href=\"../Conditionals3\">prior activity</a> ; this time, you can draw an arrow back to one of the flowchart elements to show the loop!"
        - "Why isnâ€™t the code example from the first model written as a <code>while</code> loop?  How might this result in telling someone to \"play outside\" while it is raining?"      
        - Modify this code to implement a <code>checkIfRaining()</code> function that generates a random number between 1 and 10, and returns <code>true</code> if the number is greater than 7 (and return <code>false</code> otherwise).
        - "Develop an algorithm to determine if two <code>String</code> variables are equal."
