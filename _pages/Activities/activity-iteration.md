excerpt: "CS173: Intro to Computer Science - Iteration"

info:
  goals: 
    - To be able to explain the uses of the different loop structures (<code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>do</code>)
    - To be able to apply boolean expressions to iterative structures via the <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, and <code>do</code> loops
    - To be able to apply iteration and conditionals to a <code>String</code>

        Conditionals can be used to repeatedly execute code.  There are three varieties of these “loops:” the for loop (which is useful when counting the number of iterations that are needed), the while loop (which is useful for executing until something is true), and the do loop (similar to the while loop, but it executes at least once and checks whether it should stop at the end of the loop, rather than at the beginning).

      title: The <code>for</code> Loop
      questions:
        - The code prints the numbers from 0 through 9.  Why doesn’t it also print the value 10?
        - What could you do to change this to print the values 0 through 10?  
        - What could you do to print the values 1 through 10?
        - What might you change in the code to print only the even values between 0 and 9, changing only the line beginning with for?

            public static void main(String[] args) {
                boolean raining = false;

      title: The <code>while</code> Loop
      questions:
        - Why isn’t this code example written as a do loop?  How might this result in telling someone to “play outside” while it is raining?
        - Modify this code to implement a <code>checkIfRaining()</code> function that generates a random number between 1 and 10, and returns <code>true</code> if the number is greater than 7 (and return <code>false</code> otherwise).

      questions:
        - "For what values of <code>i</code> will the character <code>&lsquo;t&rsquo;</code> be found in this <code>String</code>?  You may find the <a href=https://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/java_visualize/>Java Visualizer</a> or your IDE debugger helpful."
        - "Write a function that accepts a <code>String x</code>, a <code>char c</code>, and an <code>int n</code>.  Return the index of the <code>n&rsquo;th</code> instance of the character <code>c</code> in the <code>String x</code>.  Use the <code>indexOf()</code> method in a loop."
