# Software Environment

We will be using the Java programming language in this class. The purpose of the class is not to become an expert in Java, but rather to use Java in the service of learning about other topics in computer science. To make this as easy as possible, we will start with an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) known as **Neatbeans**, which will make it easy to organize your projects and to run the code you write. It also has some nice tools to help you [debug]({{ site.baseurl }}#patienceanddebugging). 

Please visit these links to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) and NetBeans.  You will install the JDK first, and then NetBeans.  Most Windows and Linux users will want the **x64** downloads for each of these.

* [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
    * If you are prompted on the download page, you can select "JDK Download"
* [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html)
    * If you are prompted on the download page, you can click "Download" under the "Apache NetBeans" heading (there might be a version number of even the letters "LTS" - meaning "Long Term Support" version; these are fine)

Here are a few notes to help you:

* You will need to allow the installer to make changes to your computer (the software is safe).
* It is fine to use the default location for NetBeans and the JDK.
* Please contact me if you have any difficulty installing or running NetBeans.

**NOTE:** You may also use [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/kepler/sr1/eclipse-ide-java-developers), [IntelliJ Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), or the terminal (`javac` and `java`) if you are more comfortable with them, but the default option is Netbeans, and we will be working through examples in class and in labs with Netbeans.  Also, there is a [combined download of Java and NetBeans](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-netbeans-jsp-3413139-esa.html) in a single installer.  You are welcome to use this, but it is an older version of the software, so things might look a little different from the examples in class.

# Instructions for Creating NetBeans Projects And JUnit Tests

To create a new project, first select `File->New Project`

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/netbeans/NewProject.png)

Then, select type "Java Application" and click Next

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/netbeans/JavaApplication.png)

Choose a location and a name for the project. You can uncheck the "Create Main Class" box unless, you want a file with an automatically generated file that runs when you click the play button for this project. But we're going to start from scratch in this example without a main

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/netbeans/ProjectName.png)

Once the project has been created, you can make a new class by right clicking on default projects and clicking `New->Java Class`. This will create a new Java file with the name of the class you've chosen

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/netbeans/NewJavaClass.png)

Starting a new class like this without a package that you've chosen will create a completely empty class definition. We have to add some methods to it ourselves, including a main if we want it to do something when we right click on it and type "run." For now, we'll add a public static method that returns true if an integer is even and false otherwise:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/netbeans/ClassWithMethod.png)

Let's say we want to test this method we just wrote with [JUnit](https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/junit-intro.html). Right click on the class file, then choose `Tools -> Create/Update tests`

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/netbeans/CreateUpdateTests.png)

Then, check/uncheck the following boxes

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/netbeans/TestOptions.png)

This will create a new file for testing with an example test method for each method you created in your original class. You should be careful to comment out or delete the `fail` line at the end of the test, and be sure that your inputs and expected outputs are the expected behavior of your method. Once you've done this, you can right click on this file and click `run`, and the results of the test will be shown in a window:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/netbeans/RunTests.png)

If you are interested in trying this test case out for yourself, here is the code from the screenshot above.  This test case asks if 1 is an even number, and should pass because it expects that the function will return  `false`.

```java
public class NewClassTest {
	public NewClassTest() {
	}

	@Test
	public void testIsEven() {
		System.out.println("isEven");
		int num = 1;
		boolean expResult = false;
		boolean result = NewClass.isEven(num);
		assertEquals(result, expResult);
		//fail("The test case failed");
	}
}
```

## Using the Debugger

In addition to testing, NetBeans includes a debugger that can help identify errors in your code (especially when a test case fails!).  Here is an [article]({{ site.baseurl }}/NetBeans/Debugging) on using the NetBeans debugger for your projects.

## Exporting To Zip

If you want to export your whole project to a zip, go to `File->Export Project->To ZIP`

# Coding Style

Significant emphasis is placed upon [good coding style]({{ site.baseurl }}/Style-Guide) as we introduce the fundamental concepts of software development.  This is because it is so important to be able to read others' code easily.  Following a few guidelines will help all of us to write  consistent code in a way that does not hide the details of your approach in obscurity.  Even I must admit to forgetting the rationale behind complex code that I had written only a few weeks prior!  Had I followed these guidelines more closely, I would have saved so much time in the long run by not having to re-read, re-understand, and, sometimes, re-write my old code.  

There is an added challenge in learning to code while simultaneously learning to code well, but practicing good habits is the key to learning those good habits.  To help you do this, there is a [plugin for NetBeans](http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/3413/checkstyle-beans) called [CheckStyle](https://www.sickboy.cz/checkstyle/).  The plugin will flag some common poor code styles just like it flags syntax errors and unused variables, to help you optimize your style as you write and to catch potential issues before you forget how your code works (this really does happen!).

You can direct NetBeans to automatically download this plugin.  In NetBeans, go to `Tools->Plugins` and click the `Settings` tab

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/netbeans/netbeanspluginsettings.png)

Click `Add` to provide NetBeans with the URL of the plugin repository which houses our plugins, and paste the following repository URL: `http://www.sickboy.cz/checkstyle/autoupdate/autoupdate-3.xml`.  By installing the plugin directly through NetBeans using a plugin repository, updates to the plugin will be detected and automatically downloaded by NetBeans over time.

Now, you can actually select the plugins from this repository.  To do this, go to `Tools->Plugins` again, and go to the `Available Plugins` tab

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/netbeans/netbeansaddplugins.png)

Check the two plugins `Checkstyle Beans Library` and `Checkstyle Beans Plugin`, and then click `Install`.  You may need to read and accept a licence agreement or other confirmation prompts to install.

Now CheckStyle should be installed.  One final step remains: to configure CheckStyle with the types of code style rules that should be checked.  CheckStyle is a nice tool for allowing teams to write consistent code together according to best practices, and also to standards (for example, Google has their own custom set of rules to ensure that everyone writes their code in the same style, even beyond best practices).  A configuration file is used to specify these rules.  We have created a style file that you can use that includes many of the [Style Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/Style-Guide) rules, without adding too many additional rules that would be overly pedantic.  

You can download our configuration file [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/checkstyle.xml).  To add our CheckStyle configuration file to the plugin, go to `Tools->Options` and then the `Miscellaneous` tab.  You will see a tab below this called `CheckStyle`.  Click `Browse` next to the `Configuration File` box, and select the file you just downloaded.
