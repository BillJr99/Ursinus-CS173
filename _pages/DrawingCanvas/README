... and, if so, a link to the reveal page in drawingcanvas-replay.html:
finishedvideo: 
  link: "./Reveal"
  text: "If you participated prior to December 13, 2021, click to see your finished videos here!"
  
4. Set faye link and replay link to replits in drawingcanvas-replay.html and postit-instructions.html; ensure they are running and the database in replay is removed

NOTES:
* Original standalone version in drawingcanvas-standalone.html
* numcols must be less than or equal to 26, because the column to index calculation assumes that the column heading is a single character
* Posterizer Program in CS173 Resources/postits under Ursinus
* The page width (in _layouts) must be at least the width of the image being displayed plus approximately 200px
