1. Install post-it image files to /files/drawingcanvas-X/*

2. Set js location and size variables in drawingcanvas.html and postit-instructions.html
canvascolors is the size of the palettes variable in the js file
canvaswidth and canvasheight in the full image is generally numcols * subcols * 12, (same for rows) in drawingcanvas-replay.html, and * 100 in postit-instructions.html

3. Add any finished videos links in reveal.html:
finishedvideos:
  - link: "https://www.youtube.com/embed/iyVo0tj_Ftg"
    width: 896
    height: 504
... and, if so, a link to the reveal page in drawingcanvas-replay.html:
finishedvideo: 
  link: "./Reveal"
  text: "If you participated prior to December 13, 2021, click to see your finished videos here!"
  
4. Set faye link and replay link to replits in drawingcanvas-replay.html and postit-instructions.html; ensure they are running and the database in replay is removed
fayelink: "https://FayePubSub.jpopyack.repl.co"
replaylink: "https://ReplayDataStore.jpopyack.repl.co"
 
5. Set clickable to false, dogrid to true, dofreedraw to false in drawingcanvas-replay.html

6. Set survey link if desired in postit-instructions.html
surveylink: "https://forms.gle/MwwEtBHWLHqxDpzm6"

NOTES:
* Original standalone version in drawingcanvas.html
* numcols must be less than or equal to 26, because the column to index calculation assumes that the column heading is a single character
