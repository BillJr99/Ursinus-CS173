At various times during the course, you will be asked to write a brief self-assessment \[[^1]\] (one page is fine, though there is no limit) that includes a grade on your performance to date (out of the number of points given here).

## Pre-Assessment

At the pre-assessment stage, you should consider and discuss the ways in which you feel most comfortable contributing to the class, and the ways in which you would like to develop new skills in collaborating with your peers.  For example, you may feel comfortable providing written feedback on message boards or on our chat forum, or answering questions in class, but less comfortable contributing directly to classroom discussions.  You should identify at least two areas in which you plan to emphasize your contributions to the classroom environment through participation, and one area that you plan to develop with me.  I'd like to know your thoughts about this so that I can better emphasize your strengths in classroom activities while also providing opportunities for you to grow outside of your comfort zone.  No self-assigned grade or assessment is required at the pre-assessment step.

Please refer to the [Self-Assessment](./SelfAssessment) that you will complete later to get a better idea of the reflections you'll be doing.
