At various times during the course, you will be asked to write a brief self-assessment \[[^1]\] (one page is fine, though there is no limit) that includes a grade on your performance to date (out of the number of points given here).

## Pre-Assessment

At the pre-assessment stage, you should consider and discuss the ways in which you feel most comfortable contributing to the class, and the ways in which you would like to develop new skills in collaborating with your peers.  For example, you may feel comfortable providing written feedback on message boards or on our chat forum, or answering questions in class, but less comfortable contributing directly to classroom discussions.  You should identify at least two areas in which you plan to emphasize your contributions to the classroom environment through participation, and one area that you plan to develop with me.  I'd like to know your thoughts about this so that I can better emphasize your strengths in classroom activities while also providing opportunities for you to grow outside of your comfort zone.  No self-assigned grade or assessment is required at the pre-assessment step.

## Self-Assessment

During each self-assessment, you should evaluate and provide a grade on your performance in light of the areas you highlighted in the pre-assessment stage.  Areas to consider in your self-evaluation might include some or all of the following items (and beyond) \[[^1]\]:

* Completing your work on-time
* Showing up regularly
* Participation, including the quality of your contributions in Zoom, on Canvas, in both small group and big group discussions, listening and note-taking as well as speaking; the quality of your written work, including reflections and activity question prompts
* How happy you are with your performance and the effort you put in
* The extent to which you engaged deeply with the readings and class discussions
* Your role in contributing to your classmatesâ€™ learning, including asking questions and active listening
* What this class has led you to question, realize, and/or understand

The grade you assign should be based on your ability to speak to the considerations above and in your pre-assessment.  The grade you assign will be the grade recorded for these activities unless there is a significant disparity between the assessment and your observed classroom performance.  To do this honestly, and not overly harshly, consider your evaluation from a third-person perspective: how might you evaluate yourself if you observed your activities and behaviors from another's perspective?  Have you contributed to the class in ways that has enhanced someone else's learning experience?  Have you engaged with others in ways that has enhanced your own learning experience?
