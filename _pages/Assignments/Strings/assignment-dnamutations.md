[Nucleic Acid (NA) Sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence) like DNA and RNA are organic chains of phosphates and sugars that encode that encode genetic information about living things.  These chains mutate in various ways through reproduction and as a result of cellular damage (for example, through UV from sunlight).  We represent the four DNA nucleotide bases as (A)denine, (C)ytosine, (G)uanine, and (T)hymine, using the letters A, C, G, and T, respectively.  An example DNA chain might be represented as AATCC.  Here is an example RNA chain from [Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/RNA-codon.png) (which uses additional nucleotide bases such as (U)racil, represented by the letter U).

![An RNA Chain from Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/RNA-codon.png)

In this assignment we will restrict ourselves to DNA bases A, C, G, and T.  Each of these bases has a complement, as follows:

* The complement of A is T (and vice-versa)
* The complement of C is G (and vice-versa)

A substring of DNA bases (for example, ACTG) might appear later in the chain in the form of its complement, in reverse.  That is, the complement of ACTG is TGAC (the A became a T, the C became a G, the T became an A, and the C became a G).  In this example, ACTG is referred to as a sense, and its reversed complement is called an antisense.  When we reverse TGAC, we obtain CAGT, and this is the antisense of the sense ACTG.  A DNA chain with this sense/antisense pattern might be represented as ACTG...CAGT (with zero or more additional bases occurring in the middle).

## Part 1: Detecting Differences in NA Chains
Given two strings, compute their percentage difference, character by character.  If the lengths are different, the difference of their lengths count as differences as well.  For example, "ACCG" and "ACTG" would differ by 25%, because 1 character is different out of the 4.  "ACCG" and "ACCGT" would differ by 20%, because 1 character is different out of a possible 5 (the length of the largest string).  This can be represented as a `double` (for example, 0.25 for 25%, and 0.2 for 20%).

## Part 2: Detecting an Antisense
Next, write a function to search one NA chain for the existence of an antisense.  As a parameter, pass the sense chain whose antisense you are searching for.  Return a boolean if you find it.  This function will need to call two other functions - one to compute the complement of the sense (the "antisense"), and next function to reverse that antisense chain string.  If you do those two things first, detecting the antisense becomes a simpler matter of searching one string for another.

Loop through the string, character by character, and obtain a substring starting at that point (up to the length of the antisense you're seeking).  If that substring matches your antisense, your search is successful.  If you reach the end of the string without finding the antisense, return `false`.

When manipulating string indices, it is very important to avoid off-by-one errors.  For example, the `substring(start, end)` method starts at the index `start` but ends at the index `end - 1`, which can be confusing.  Compounding the confusion is that string indices start counting at 0, like most arrays do.  From the [javadoc documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#substring(int,%20int)) for `substring`, we see that the `substring(1, 5)` of "smiles" is "mile".  

If you are looping through your string, take care to stop searching not only prior to the end of the string (as you normally would), but at the point at which the substring you are searching for would run past the end of the string.  For example, if you are searching for "ACC" in "CGCTG", you could stop searching once you reach the "T", because there is no room for "ACC" to fit there.  Your loop terminating condition will be a value less than `chain.length()`, where `chain` is the sequence you're searching within (i.e., "CGCTG") - **what should it be instead (hint: it is related to `subchain.length()`, where `subchain` is the sequence you're searching for, i.e. "ACC")?**

Prior to writing your code, draw a grid representing the string you're searching for, and number the indices from 0 to the length of the string.  Then draw a grid representing the chain you're searching within (again, from 0 to the length of that chain).  Step through the search procedure on paper so that you can see the indices that you'll be working with.  **How do your indices relate to the lengths of the source and target subchains?**  This will provide you the answers you need to implement your algorithm!

### Computing the Complement of an NA Chain
Given an NA chain string, return a new string representing its complement.  This should be a string of the same length as the original; however, each character should be replaced with its complement.  That is, all the A's should be switched to T's (and vice-versa), and all the C's should become G's (and vice-versa).

**Question: why do you need to return a new string?  Since strings are represented as arrays of characters, why can't you manipulate the input string paramter directly?  Even if you could, why do you think it is a good idea to create a new string anyway?**

### Reversing a Chain
Given an NA chain string, return a new string of the same length but with all the characters reversed.  That is, "ATCG" becomes "GCTA".

### Compute an Antisense
Using the two functions you just wrote to compute the complement and the reverse of a chain, write a function to compute the antisense of a given NA chain.  To do this, compute the complement of the chain, and then reverse it.

## Part 3: Inserting a Chain
Given an NA chain string, an NA subchain, and a position, insert the subchain into the chain.  For example, `insert("ACCG", "TT", 2)` would return "ACTTCG" (recall that the indices start at 0, so the TT occupies position 3 and 4 in the string, which are indices 2 and 3.

## Part 4: Removing a Chain
Given an NA chain string and an NA subchain, remove all instances of the subchain from the chain.  For example, `remove("ACCGCC", "CC")` would return "AG".

Note that Java Strings now have a method `replaceAll` that will do this for you.  I definitely encourage you to use this.  However, you may notice that these helper methods don't always exist across many of the string operations we're exploring here.  So, there is significant value in practicing with string indexing.  For full credit on this problem, implement your own replacement algorithm to accomplish this without calling a `replace` or `replaceAll` string method.  However, it would be a good idea to write a unit test that compares your results to a call to `replaceAll`, and you should feel both free and encouraged to do so!

**Question: Why might you need to create an `ArrayList` to represent your new strings as you construct them, before returning the final result?  Why can't you simply construct a new empty string and append each character to it as you iterate?**

## Part 5: Testing

Write unit tests for each part of this assignment.  You will need more than one test case per part.  Your test cases should include boundary conditions (for example, inserting or removing to the beginning, middle, and end of a string).  Your goal is to uncover errors with your test cases.  Because of 0-indexing, and off-by-one errors, an algorithm can appear to work fine as long as you manipulate the middle of a chain, but then break when you are dealing with the beginning or end.  Even I made an error while completing this assignment that was only uncovered when I tried to execute it at the end of a chain.  These mistakes are very easy to make, and you should assume that your code contains these bugs.  Think of testing like a game: your goal is to cause your software to break (that's how we identify bugs to fix and make our software more robust!).  

**Question What test cases would you write in order to try to do that?**
