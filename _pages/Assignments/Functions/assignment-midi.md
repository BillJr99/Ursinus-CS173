The [Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) standard enables your computer to play synthesizer music that you can control programmatically.

## Adding the MIDI library to your project

To use this jar, after creating a Gradle Java project in Netbeans, add the following line inside the `dependencies` section of your `build.gradle` file:

```
compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: '*.jar')
```

If you do not have a dependencies section, you can add one as follows:

```
dependencies {
    compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: '*.jar')
}
```

Now, jar files added to the libs directory of your project will be available for use in your code.  Download and copy the [MIDILib.jar]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/asmt-midi/MIDILib.jar) file into a subdirectory of your project called `libs`.  See the [Javadoc]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/asmt-midi/javadoc/index.html) for more information about the library \[[^1], [^2], [^3], [^4], [^5], [^6]\].

## Instantiating a MIDIPlayer object

The MIDI library you imported includes a `MIDIPlayer` class that you can instantiate to help you play sounds through your computer.  You can create one like you would any object variable, with the `new` keyword:

```java 
MIDIPlayer player = new MIDIPlayer();
```

Be sure to add the import for `MIDIPlayer` to your program (we'll go ahead and add the imports for the other library classes that we'll need later as well):

```java
import com.MIDI.MIDIPlayer;
import com.MIDI.Instruments;
import com.MIDI.Notes;
```

Open the [Javadoc]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/asmt-midi/javadoc/index.html) to find out about the method interface this library provides.  There are a number of methods you can call inside the `MIDIPlayer` class.  **What are a few of them, and, in your own words, what do they do?**

In addition, there are two classes `Instruments` and `Notes` which contain constants that represent some of the instruments, notes, and note durations that you can play.  These include `Notes.NOTE_C4` for a C4 note, `Instruments.GUITAR` for a guitar, and `Notes.NOTE_QUARTER` which specifies a quarter note duration.  Click on the `Instruments` and `Notes` javadoc classes and make a note of some of the instruments and notes that are available to you.  Because it's a synthesizer, some of the "instruments" are actually creative sound effects - feel free to have fun with this!

Javadoc documentation is really helpful because it enables you to observe functionality made available by a library "at a glance."  You can see how methods are named, information about how they are invoked, and what parameters they require.  These are generated programmatically through comments that you write throughout your code, and this is prescribed by the [Style Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/Style-Guide#documentationoverview).

## Part 1: Playing a Note

Let's test the interface and the computer sound setup by playing a note using a synthesized instrument.  The MIDI interface works by defining a number of "channels" on which you can play notes, chords, and sounds.  You can think of a channel as a particular instrument.  In fact, you can assign an instrument to a channel.  The default channel is "channel 0," but you can have several more of them, referenced by number.  In this assignment, we will stick with the default channel, but feel free to see me if you are interested in extending this to multiple channels and instruments.

To do this, you can first set an instrument on the default channel by calling the following method of the `MIDIPlayer` library:

```java
player.setInstrument(Instruments.HARP);
```

Here, `Instruments.HARP` is the instrument that you want to use.  This will assign the harp to the default channel 0.  To play a note, you can call the following function:

```java
player.playNote(Notes.NOTE_C4, Notes.NOTE_QUARTER, Notes.DEFAULT_INTENSITY);
```

This will play a C4 quarter note, using a default intensity value.

Try it and verify that you get sound output.  Try changing this to play an A4 whole note at half intensity.  The A4 note is a higher pitched note, and this is because A4 is a higher frequency vibration which your ear perceives as a higher pitch.  In fact, A4 is defined here as 440 Hz, and, consequently, C4 (known as "middle C") is ~262 Hz. Every note is defined by its own fundamental frequency.  Incidentally, there is repitition here: **if A3 is 220 Hz, what frequency do you think C3 is?**  **How about A2?**  You can try listening to some notes and frequencies using this [online tone generator](https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/).

## Part 2: Playing a Song

Using the playNote function, try playing the first part of the "alphabet song," (actually, it's basically [Twinkle Twinkle Little Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twinkle,_Twinkle,_Little_Star)) which plays the following quarter notes: `C4 C4 G4 G4 A4 A4 G4`.

Now, try adding the second part: `F4 F4 E4 E4 D4 D4 D4 D4 C4`.  Note that there are more notes in this part than the first: to align the time, the D4 notes should be eighth notes instead of quarter notes.

There should have been a brief pause between the first part (`C4 C4 G4 G4 A4 A4 G4`) and the second part (`F4 F4 E4 E4 D4 D4 D4 D4 C4`).  The following function call will introduce a "rest" or pause (in this case, equivalent to an eighth note duration) in between the parts:

```java
MIDIPlayer.rest(Notes.NOTE_EIGHTH);
```

Try inserting this in between the parts.  

You might notice that we are calling `MIDIPlayer.rest()` while we call `player.playNote()` elsewhere.  **Both come from the same code library, so what's the difference?**  Take a look at the [Javadoc]({{ site.baseurl }}/files/asmt-midi/javadoc/index.html) and notice that the `rest()` method is a `static` function.  This means that the `rest()` method is not specific to a particular `MIDIPlayer`, and so it belongs to the class rather than to the object.  A "rest" does not actually play a sound, so you are not using the variables and methods of the MIDIPlayer object variable to accomplish this.  It's generic to any `MIDIPlayer`, so it's not necessary to call the function on any particular variable.  Notice that the constants in `Instruments` and `Notes` are also static - they aren't unique to any one `MIDIPlayer` - every student is using the same ones regardless of the computer they're using or the program they're writing.  As a rule of thumb: if you don't need to call `new` to get a variable first in order to use a method or variable from that class, it could probably be declared `static.`  

Finish the alphabet song.  Here are the notes, which are quarter notes unless otherwise specified (I suggest adding an eighth note duration rest in between each part):

```
C4 C4 G4 G4 A4 A4 G4(1/2 note)
F4 F4 E4 E4 D4(1/8th note) D4(1/8th note) D4(1/8th note) D4(1/8th note) C4(1/2 note)
G4 G4 F4 (rest 1/16th note) E4 E4 D4(1/2 note)
G4(1/8th note) G4(1/8th note) G4(1/8th note) F4 (rest 1/16th note) E4 E4 D4(1/2 note)
C4 C4 G4 G4 A4 A4 G4(1/2 note)
F4 F4 E4 E4 D4 D4 C4(1/2 note)
```

For fun, try changing the instrument to a guitar before playing the song: 

```java
player.setInstrument(Instruments.GUITAR);
```

Compare the result to [Twinkle Twinkle Little Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twinkle,_Twinkle,_Little_Star) (there is a MIDI rendition on the Wikipedia page that you can play!).  **There are a few small differences to make the alphabet fit into the song - can you spot them?**  **What would you change in your program to match [Twinkle Twinkle Little Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twinkle,_Twinkle,_Little_Star)?**

## Part 3: Using Functions to Enable Code Re-Use and Repitition

Did you notice that part of the song repeats?  The first part is exactly the same as the fifth part!  You can avoid having to do this extra work of copying and pasting your code using functions.  In addition to saving you some typing, functions a standard good practice in case it becomes necessary to change that part of the song in a way that affects every use of the part.  With a function, you can change the song once, and have it play correctly both times that you use it.

Define a function `playMainPart()` that contains the code to play the `C4 C4 G4 G4 A4 A4 G4` part, and modify your program so that you call this function each of the two times you want to play that part in the song.

## Part 4: Make Up Your Own Song
Every answer is correct - be creative and play some notes.  Explore the Notes class and the Instruments class for a few examples that you can play.  Let me know if you come up with something fun that you'd be willing to share - we can take a few minutes in class sometime for a few "code demonstrations."

## Part 5: Just for Fun...

When we explore arrays and loops, we will see how we can represent a song like this using a single variable (an "array") that represents the entire collection of notes, and this can be played using a single call to the function to play all the notes.  "Loops" can iterate over these collections, one by one, and automatically play each note, so that you don't have to copy your code like you did here.

If you'd like to try out chords using arrays, try running the following code in your program:

```java
player.setInstrument(Instruments.GUITAR);
       
int chordNotes[] = {Notes.NOTE_C4, Notes.NOTE_E4, Notes.NOTE_G4};
player.playChord(chordNotes, Notes.NOTE_WHOLE, Notes.DEFAULT_INTENSITY);
```

You may not be familiar with the notation yet, but we are asking the synthesizer to play three notes instead of just one.  This is called a chord (in this case, the chord is comprised of the  C4, E4, and G4 notes).  `chordNotes` is called an array: it is a variable that contains a collection of multiple values, rather than just a single value.

If you are familiar with older versions of Microsoft Windows, you might be familiar with these sounds (OK, this rendition is far from faithful, but I am admittedly not musically inclined!  You may need to use your imagination here...):

```java
player.setInstrument(Instruments.BRIGHT_PIANO);
        
player.playNote(Notes.NOTE_D4, Notes.NOTE_QUARTER, Notes.DEFAULT_INTENSITY);
player.playNote(Notes.NOTE_D3, Notes.NOTE_SIXTEENTH, Notes.DEFAULT_INTENSITY);
player.playNote(Notes.NOTE_A3, Notes.NOTE_SIXTEENTH, Notes.DEFAULT_INTENSITY);
player.playNote(Notes.NOTE_G3, Notes.NOTE_EIGHTH, Notes.DEFAULT_INTENSITY);
player.playNote(Notes.NOTE_D3, Notes.NOTE_EIGHTH, Notes.DEFAULT_INTENSITY);
player.playNote(Notes.NOTE_D4, Notes.NOTE_EIGHTH, Notes.DEFAULT_INTENSITY);
int[] notes = {Notes.NOTE_A4, Notes.NOTE_A3};
player.playChord(notes, Notes.NOTE_HALF, Notes.DEFAULT_INTENSITY);
        
MIDIPlayer.rest(Notes.NOTE_WHOLE);
        
player.playNote(Notes.NOTE_G4, Notes.NOTE_EIGHTH, Notes.DEFAULT_INTENSITY);
player.playNote(Notes.NOTE_D4, Notes.NOTE_EIGHTH, Notes.DEFAULT_INTENSITY);
player.playNote(Notes.NOTE_G3, Notes.NOTE_EIGHTH, Notes.DEFAULT_INTENSITY);
player.playNote(Notes.NOTE_A3, Notes.NOTE_HALF, Notes.DEFAULT_INTENSITY);
        
MIDIPlayer.rest(Notes.NOTE_WHOLE);
```

Take a look at the `playChord` function call.  **What is different about it from the calls to `playNote`?**  We know that it is playing multiple notes together (in this case, A4 and A3).  **How do we know this?**
