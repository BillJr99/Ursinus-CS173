## Debugging Table

Please submit to your class notebook your Debugging Table.  The Debugging Table is a list of errors, which you can write down or screen-shot, along with an explanation of the error and how you fixed it.  The format is up to you, but a reasonable entry might look like this:

```
Example.java:5: error: cannot find symbol
                System.out.println(y);
                                   ^
  symbol:   variable y
  location: class Example

I had initialized a variable x in the following example, but accidentally printed a variable called y.  Since y didn't exist, the print statement on line 5 of my Example.java file failed.  I changed this to print x instead, and it worked!

int x = 5;
System.out.println(y);
```

You should have one such entry for each new error that you encounter.
