The [Iris Flower Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) is a classic dataset proposed by [R. A. Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) to demonstrate the use of the Fisher Linear Discriminant, which is a classic instrument to separate and classify data.  

In this assignment, you will read the classic Iris dataset, and use information obtained about different types of flowers to predict what kind of flower an unknown specimen is knowing only its measured data values.  

Here are examples of the three flowers, taken from the [Iris Flower Dataset Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set):

The dataset can be [downloaded](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) and saved into your project directory.  On the [Iris download page](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris), click the `Data Folder` link, and then download the `iris.data` file.  The format of this file is a [Comma Separated Value (CSV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file, meaning that each token on a line is separated by a comma character (as opposed to spaces which we used earlier).  This particular CSV does not have a header, so even the first row of data is an actual data record.  The format of the file is as follows:

```
SepalLength,SepalWidth,PetalLength,PetalWidth,SpeciesClassification
```

The lengths and widths are numeric values, and the classification is either `setosa`, `versicolor`, or `virginica`.  Given the sepal and petal widths and lengths, we can make a prediction about new types of flowers whose classification is unknown to us.  Generally, the more examples we have of each type of flower, the more accurate our prediction will be.

Here is a sample of the data, taken from [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data):

```
5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
4.7,3.2,1.3,0.2,Iris-setosa
4.6,3.1,1.5,0.2,Iris-setosa
5.0,3.6,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa
```

Before we begin, open the CSV file in your favorite spreadsheet program.  You'll see four numeric columns and a classification, as you saw above.  Plot any two of the numeric columns on a scatterplot graph.  **What do you notice?**  Here is an example of such a plot comparing the Sepal Width *vs* the Sepal Length, taken from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/):

![Sepal Width vs Sepal Length Plot, with Flower Classifications Color Coded from scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_plot_iris_dataset_002.png)

## Part 1: Reading the CSV File
Open the CSV file for reading.  Since it is a CSV file, a `BufferedReader` is a good choice, as we can read the text line-by-line.  Using the `split` function, you can obtain an array of values for each row.  This array will contain the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, and the known classification of that particular flower.  The `split` function accepts a `String` parameter representing the delimiter character on which to split.  For a CSV, that's the comma character.

## Part 2: Obtaining the Features
Using an `ArrayList`, gather all the sepal lengths, sepal widths, petal lengths, and petal widths by iterating over the text file and splitting each line.  If the classification is a `setosa` flower, store that in a separate array.  Similarly, use separate arrays for the `versicolor` and `virginica` flowers as well.  By the time you are finished reading the text file, you should have an array containing all the `setosa` petal lengths, one for all the `setosa` petal widths, and so on.

Compute the mean and variance of these arrays.  The formulas for the mean and variance are provided for your convenience:

Mean (<span>\\(\mu\\)</span>): <span>\\(\mu = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}\\)</span><br>
Variance (<span>\\(\sigma^{2}\\)</span>): <span>\\(\sigma^{2} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} ((x_{i}-\mu)^{2})}{n}\\)</span>

## Part 3: Classifying a New Flower
Using the Means you just computed, which we call our data featuress, we will try to determine the classification of an unknown flower.  Make up values for a flower based on the data that you see in the Iris data set.  Try to choose values that you know should align with one classification of flower over the others (that is, choose values close to the bunch of values for a particular type of flower); this way, you can check your work.  To classify our unknown flower, we will consider the means of the sepal lengths, sepal widths, petal lengths, and petal widths as points in 4-dimensional space.  Your unknown flower is also a point in 4-D space, and it is going to be closer to one of those mean points than it is to the others.  The means with the smallest distance is going to be our prediction.  From geometry, you may recall the Euclidean Distance as a measure of precisely this distance.  Here is the formula:

Euclidean Distance: <span>\\(d = \sqrt{(x_{petalLength}-\mu_{petalLength})^{2} + (x_{petalWidth}-\mu_{petalWidth})^{2} + (x_{petalLength}-\mu_{petalLength})^{2} + (x_{sepalWidth}-\mu_{sepalWidth})^{2}}\\)</span>

Where <span>\\(\mu\\)</span> represents the mean of a particular feature (such as the `petalWidth`) for a particular flower (such as the `versicolor`).  This means that we're computing the mean of all the `petalWidth` values that corresponded to the `versicolor` flower.

You will compute three of these Euclidean Distances: one using the means of the `setosa` flower, one using the means of the `versicolor` flower, and one using the means of the `virginica` flower.  `x` is your made up flower that you're looking to classify.  So, for the first Euclidean Distance, when you consider the `setosa` flower, you should compute <span>\\(\mu_{petalLength}\\)</span>, <span>\\(\mu_{petalWidth}\\)</span>, <span>\\(\mu_{sepalLength}\\)</span>, and <span>\\(\mu_{sepalWidth}\\)</span> as the means of those columns, but only for those rows that correspond to a `setosa` classification in the input data set.  By doing this, we are "teaching" our algorithm about what a `setosa` flower "looks like" according to these data features.  This is called "training" the algorithm.  If we provide enough examples, and as long as the features that we compute from those examples (like the mean) differentiate one flower from another, we'll be able to predict unknown flowers based on its own features by comparing them to the training features we're computing now.  In this case, that comparison is being made using the Euclidean Distance, which tells us how "close" or "far" an unknown flower is from the training features (in this case, the means) we observed.

Print out all of your Euclidean Distances, and choose the flower corresponding to the smallest Euclidean Distance you calculated.  That is your prediction.  Change the values of your made up flower and see how you do predicting it!

## Part 4: Experimenting with the Data

### Classifying the Input Samples
Re-read each line of the Iris Dataset CSV file.  This time, pretend that you do not know the classification, and use those values as your "made up flower" to be classified.  In your program, compare your classification to the actual classification from the CSV, and print out your accuracy rate.

### Studying the Effect of More or Fewer Samples
**What happens if you only read 10, 5, or 1 example of a `setosa` flower?**  Modify your program to read only the first N rows of each of the flower types.  **How well are you able to predict your flowers?**  Use the accuracy rate you computed above, and graph your accuracy over N=1, 5, 10, and the whole dataset.

### Fisher Linear Discriminant
It is usually the case that adding more rows to our input data results in better classification (at least to a plateau).  However, it's not always the case that adding more columns ("features") to the dataset makes for better prediction.  If we use too many columns, our accuracy actually starts to decrease.  **If we needed to remove some columns, how would we choose which columns to keep and which to remove?**  Let's find out which column(s) are helping us classify the data the best.  We can do this by computing the Fisher Linear Discriminant (developed by Fisher, who also provided this classic Iris dataset).  

The key idea behind Fisher's Linear Discriminant is that data can be separated into classes if those classes have a relatively small variance, and the data between the classes have a relatively high variance.  Imagine two different coins (for example, an American quarter and an American dime).  The quarter has a large radius and weight compared to the dime.  If you looked at enough quarters and dimes, each one might have a slightly different radius and weight because of wear and tear, but generally, they would be close together, but the radius and weight of each dime would differ greatly from those of the quarter.  It is important to compute features that do not overlap between classifications.  For our flower example here, our classification worked out because the petal and sepal lengths/widths were generally far apart between the different types of flowers (but also close together for each type of flower).  As a result, comparing unknown flowers to the means of these features provided a reasonable prediction of the flower type.  The Fisher LDA function gives us a mechanism to measure this feature "closeness" formally.

As you will learn in statistics, and implemented above in this assignment, the variance is a measure of the difference of the data elements to their overall mean.  Therefore, Fisher's idea can be expressed mathematically: 

<span>\\(FisherLDA \propto \frac{(\mu_{1} - \mu_{2})^{2}}{\sigma_{1}^{2} + \sigma_{2}^{2}}\\)</span>

Recall that the mean is represented by (<span>\\(\mu\\)</span>), and the variance is represented by (<span>\\(\sigma^{2}\\)</span>).

The FisherLDA is large when the numerator is large and the denominator is small.  That is, when the difference of the means is large, and the sum of the variances is small.  This occurs when the means of the two classes differ greatly (like the dime and the quarter), while the variance of each is relatively small.

The Linear Discriminant function tells us how separable a feature is into two classes, and it only requires the mean and variance, which we have!  For each feature (the original arrays of the lengths/widths from the data set that you created in Part 2), compute the Linear Discriminant function for the following features:

1. The `setosa` sepal length *vs* the `versicolor` sepal length
2. The `setosa` sepal length *vs* the `virginicia` sepal length
3. The `versicolor` sepal length *vs* the `virginicia` sepal length
4. The `setosa` sepal width *vs* the `versicolor` sepal width
5. The `setosa` sepal width *vs* the `virginicia` sepal width
6. The `versicolor` sepal width *vs* the `virginicia` sepal width
7. The `setosa` petal length *vs* the `versicolor` petal length 
8. The `setosa` petal length *vs* the `virginicia` petal length 
9. The `versicolor` petal length *vs* the `virginicia` petal length 
10. The `setosa` petal width *vs* the `versicolor` petal width
11. The `setosa` petal width *vs* the `virginicia` petal width 
12. The `versicolor` petal width *vs* the `virginicia` petal width

At first glance, this seems like a lot of work!  Before you start writing code, remember that you can do this once, but implement the code in a function that accepts the two arrays as parameters.  Then, just call the functions with the right pair of arrays, and you're done!

Here are a few questions to consider about the data:

* **Which column/feature (i.e., the "sepal length") best separates the `setosa` and the `versicolor` flowers?**
* **Which column best separates the `setosa` and the `virginica` flowers?  Which column seems the best overall?**  
* **Do any columns appear to do a poor job separating any of the classes?**  
* **Which columns would you use for our approach?**  
* **Based on your findings, which two flowers do you think are most easily distinguished between each other, and why?**

## Extra Credit (10 Points)

For extra credit, remove the columns you selected based on the Linear Fisher Discriminant in Part 4, and plot your new classification accuracies for N=1, 5, 10, and the whole dataset like you did in that part.  **Did you sacrifice any classification accuracy (and how much, if so) by removing one or more columns with relatively low LDA score?**

## Ethical Use of Learning Algorithms

### Avoiding Discrimination

Generalizing features to a mean has the potential to bias an algorithm, either unintentionally or intentionally, toward making decisions that disadvantage people.  This is known as [Algorithmic Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias).  This [case study](https://www.onlineethics.org/Resources/algorithm.aspx?id=44420&sortby=name&dir=asc&tab=teaching-aids)  \[[^1]\] describes a common scenario in which [Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) is applied to a dataset to determine which features best separate the data.  PCA is another technique for selecting the best subset of column features to use in a learning algorithm (like we did here with the Fisher LDA score).  In this example, the PCA algorithm was used to select features that are discriminatory.  **What steps can developers take to ensure that they are equitible when classifying data?**  **In particular, what can be done to avoid developing algorithms that discriminate according to implicit bias or "blind spots?"**

### Publication in the Annals of Eugenics

Like other seminal statistical tools of the day (for example, the [Student t-test](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1939.tb02192.x)), Fisher's work was [published](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x) in the Annals of Eugenics in 1936.  Wiley Publishing includes a foreword to these articles as follows:

> The articles published by the Annals of Eugenics (1925–1954) 
> have been made available online as an historical archive intended 
> for scholarly use. The work of eugenicists was often pervaded by 
> prejudice against racial, ethnic and disabled groups. The online 
> publication of this material for scholarly research purposes is 
> not an endorsement of those views nor a promotion of eugenics in 
> any way.

I endorse and echo this sentiment.  We use these statistical techniques ubiquitously throughout science, mathematics, engineering, and computation.  That ubiquity has the potential to obfuscate potentially harmful context and applications.  We will discuss this in more detail in class, but for now, let us commit to applying these valuable techniques in contexts that do no harm.  To do this successfully requires more than a mere avoidance of overt bigotry; rather, we must be mindful of implicit bias, microaggressions, and the potential for generalized and algorithmic analysis to amplify systemic bias, both implicit and overt.
