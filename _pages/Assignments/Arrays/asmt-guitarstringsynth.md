In this assignment [\[[^1]\], \[[^2]\]], you will practice with arrays and loops in a fun application that involves digital audio.

[Download the skeleton code](../files/asmt-guitarstringsynth/GuitarStringSynth-master.zip) for this assignment. You will be editing `src/guitarstring/GuitarString.java`.

We will be using the `StdAudio` library from the Princeton [algs4cs](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) repository. [View the documentation for this library here](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/javadoc/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/StdAudio.html).

## Background: Digital Audio / Musical Notes
Sound is the result of pressure waves traveling through the air. Just as our ears pick up these pressure variations and send a signal to our brain, digital microphones/ADCs are designed to turn these variations into an array of pressure samples over time (in the discussion below, we often refer to "sample" and "array index" interchangeably). Digital audio is often sampled at 44100 samples per second, which we refer to as the **sample rate** (`FS`). This means that if we want to represent 2 seconds of audio, for instance, we need an array with 88200 samples (good thing we're using arrays and don't have to define 88200 individual variables!). The reason for this is that we need a sampling frequency that's at least twice the highest frequency we want to represent. Since the highest frequency humans can hear is around 20,000hz, 44100hz is adequate. (Another fun fact about this number is it is <span>\\(2^{2} 3^{2} 5^{2} 7^{2}\\)</span>.

We'll define `FS` as a constant, as follows:

```java
public static final int FS = 44100; // sample rate of 44.1 kHz
```

### Square Waves And Pitches
One property of our perception of audio is that if a sound repeats a pattern over and over again quickly enough, we hear it as a pitch, or musical note. For example, let's consider a "square wave." The code below is a snippet from SquareWave.java in the homework 5 package which generates this pattern. The pattern will repeat itself every T elements in the array. This is referred to as the period of the audio.

```java
/**
* 
* @param T The period of the square wave
* @param a The max/min value of the square wave
* @param duration The length in seconds of the wave
* @return An array containing a square wave
*/
public static double[] getSquareWave(int T, double a, double duration) {
    // Create enough samples to hold "duration" seconds of audio
    int N = (int)Math.round(duration*FS);
    double[] audio = new double[N];
    // Loop through and fill in the array with the 
    // square wave pattern that repeats every T samples
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        if (i/(T/2) %2 == 0) {
            // The first half of the square pattern
            // is positive
            audio[i] = a;
        }
        else {
            // The second half of the square pattern
            // is negative
            audio[i] = -a;
        }
    }
    return audio;
}
```

For example, let's consider the audio we get from the following call to the method, where the period is 100 and the audio goes on for one second:

```java
double[] x = getSquareWave(100, 0.3, 1);
StdAudio.save("SquareWave100.wav", x);
```

The first 2000 samples of the array look like this:

![First 2000 samples of the audio file array with a period of 100](../images/asmt-guitarstringsynth/SquareWave100.svg)

and sounds like this:

<p>
<audio controls>
    <source src="../files/asmt-guitarstringsynth/SquareWave100.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> 
</p>

If we shorten the period to 60, we obtain this instead:

```java
double[] y = getSquareWave(60, 0.3, 1);
StdAudio.save("SquareWave60.wav", y);
```
Notice how there are more repetitions packed together over the same same number of samples. This makes the audio goes up in pitch to a higher note (the F# above concert A).  Now, the first 2000 samples of the array look like this:

![First 2000 samples of the audio file array with a period of 60](../images/asmt-guitarstringsynth/SquareWave60.svg)

and sounds like this:

<p>
<audio controls>
    <source src="../files/asmt-guitarstringsynth/2SquareWaves.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> 
</p>

We can mix these two sounds together into one composite sound by using the sumArrays method we wrote in class (which I've placed in a class called ArrayUtils in the skeleton code):

```java
double[] z = ArrayUtils.sumArrays(x, y);
StdAudio.save("2SquareWaves.wav", z);
```

which looks and sounds like this

</audio> 
</p>

### Pulse Tone Sinusoids
It's also possible to build sounds from sine waves, which we refer to as "pure tones." Given a sample rate `FS`, a period `T`, and an amplitude (loudness) `a`, the formula for the value in the array at index `i` is:

<span>\\(a \times sin(\frac{2 \pi i}{T})\\)</span>

For those who know trigonometry, you'll notice that this does indeed go through one period over `T` samples, since that will bring it from 0 to 2 <span>\\(\pi\\)</span>. The code to do this, which can be found in `Sinusoid.java` in the skeleton code, looks like this:

```java
/**
 * 
 * @param T The period of the sinusoid
 * @param a The amplitude of the sinusoid
 * @param duration The length in seconds of the wave
 * @return An array containing a sinusoid
 */
public static double[] getSinusoid(int T, double a, double duration) {
    int N = (int)Math.round(duration*FS);
    double[] audio = new double[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        audio[i] = a*Math.sin(2*Math.PI*(double)i/T);
    }
    return audio;
}
```

For example, let's consider the audio we get from the following call to the method, where the period is 100 and the audio goes on for one second:

```java
double[] x = getSinusoid(100, 0.8, 1);
StdAudio.save("Sinusoid100.wav", x);
```

The first 2000 samples of the array look like this

![First 2000 samples of the audio file array of a sinusoid with a period of 100](../images/asmt-guitarstringsynth/Sinusoid100.svg)

and the audio sounds like this (a concert A)

<p>
<audio controls>
    <source src="../files/asmt-guitarstringsynth/Sinusoid100.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> 
</p>

If we shorten the period to 60

```java
double[] y = getSinusoid(60, 0.8, 1);
StdAudio.save("Sinusoid60.wav", y);
```

then the first 2000 samples look like this

![First 2000 samples of the audio file array of a sinusoid with a period of 60](../images/asmt-guitarstringsynth/Sinusoid60.svg)

As with the square wave, there are more repetitions packed together over the same same number of samples, which makes the audio go to a higher pitch

## Main Programming Task: The Karplus-Strong Algorithm
The square waves and sinusoids sound a bit dull and unrealistic (although a real clarinet does sound a bit [like a square wave](https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/clarinet.html)). But it is possible to make a very realistic plucked guitar sound with a surprisingly simple algorithm known as the [Karplus-Strong Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karplus%E2%80%93Strong_string_synthesis), which is the starting point for [all of the digital synthesizers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_waveguide_synthesis) used in the 80s and beyond. Your job in this assignment will be to implement the Karplus-Strong algorithm in several stages by filling in three methods in `GuitarString.java`.

### Part 1: Getting the Period (25%)

Most Western string orchestras tune to a "concert A," which goes through 440 periods in one second. If our audio is sampled at 44100 samples per second, this means that each period takes up about 100 samples (which we saw in the examples above). In each octave in the Western chromatic scale, there are 12 notes total. Going from one note to its adjacent note in order is called a halfstep. For example, a B is 2 halfsteps above A. The formula for determining the period for a particular note h halfsteps away from a concert A is:

<span>\\(T = \frac{FS}{440 \times 2^{\frac{h}{12}}}\\)</span>

For example, at a sample rate of 44100, a B which is 2 halfsteps above concert A has a period of:

<span>\\(T = \frac{44100}{440 \times 2^{\frac{2}{12}}} \approx 89.29\\)</span>

Notice how the period has gotten shorter, which indeed corresponds to an increase in pitch, as we saw in the square/sinusoid examples.

It is also possible for the halfstep to be negative, in which case the formula yields a period longer than 100, for a pitch lower than 440. For example, for a G two halfsteps below concert A, the formula yields:

<span>\\(T = \frac{44100}{440 \times 2^{\frac{-2}{12}}} \approx 112.5\\)</span>

Your first task is to implement this equation in the `getPeriod` method in `GuitarString.java`. You should round the period you return to the nearest integer.

#### Hints
* Be sure you're using the correct types here, and cast if you have to! In particular, `h/12` should be a decimal number.
* Use the Math.pow function to raise a number to a power.
* Use the Math.round() function to round to the nearest integer.

### Part 2: Random Samples (25%)
The next step of the algorithm consists of coming up with some "random noise," which sounds like static. In the context of the Karplus Strong algorithm, this can be thought of as randomly stimulating the string with a pluck. To do this, you will complete the method:

```java
public static void fillRandomSamples(double[] arr, int numSamples)
```

This method should fill in the first `numSamples` indices of the array `arr` with random samples between -1.0 and 1.0. As a corner case, if the user asks for more samples than the capacity of the array, **you should fill at most the length of the array**.

For example, if you make an array that's one second long (FS samples long) and fill the entire array with noise, the code would look like this:

```java
double[] samples = new double[FS];
fillRandomSamples(samples, FS);
StdAudio.play(samples);
```

And the audio would sound like "static":

<p>
<audio controls>
    <source src="../files/asmt-guitarstringsynth/noise.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> 
</p>

If you were to plot the first 2000 samples of the array, they would look something like this (though the answer would be slightly different every time since the numbers are random)

![First 2000 samples of the audio file array of random noise](../images/asmt-guitarstringsynth/noise.svg)

#### Hints
* You can make use of Java's function `Math.random()`, which returns a random number between 0.0 and 1.0.

### Part 3: The Final Plucked Sound (50%)

Now it's time to tie everything together to get our wonderful plucked sound. You will be filling in the method:

```java
public static double[] getPluckedSound(int note, double duration, double decay)
```

The steps are as follows:
1. Given a note, find it's period `T` to the nearest integer by using your method that computes the period.
2. Setup an array with enough samples to hold `duration` seconds audio.
3. Fill in the first `T` samples with random noise using your noise method.
4. Process all of the rest of the samples one by one in order, starting at index `T`. Each value should be the average of the two adjacent samples `T` indices back multiplied by a factor of `decay`. For example, if you're at index 150 and your period is 100, you should average samples at indices 50 and 51. This simulates a traveling wave over a string of length `T` that decays and dampens "low frequencies" first, and is referred to as a "digital waveguide."

For example, if your code works properly, then the following call to your method will play a guitar string at a concert A:

```java
StdAudio.play(getPluckedSound(0, 0.5, 0.98));
```

which sounds like this

<p>
<audio controls>
    <source src="../files/asmt-guitarstringsynth/KarplusStrongConcertA.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> 
</p>

If we plot the first 2000 values of the array, we can see it starts with totally random noise in the first 100 samples, but then it gradually evens out to a periodic sound that decays over time:

![Karplus Strong Concert A](../images/asmt-guitarstringsynth/KarplusStrongConcertA.svg)

By default, the `main` function in `GuitarString.java` plays the first 24 halfsteps in sequence, which is two octaves of the chromatic scale. If your code is working properly and you run the `main`, you should hear the following sound:

<p>
<audio controls>
    <source src="../files/asmt-guitarstringsynth/ChromaticProgression.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio> 
</p>

### Extra Credit (25%)
As extra credit, you should fill in the method `playFile`, which loads in and plays a bunch of notes in sequence from a text file. The text file contains a bunch of lines with comma separated values for `halfstep,duration,decay`. For example, the "Happy Birthday" song contains the following sequence of 25 notes:

```
0,0.35,0.98
0,0.15,0.98
2,0.5,0.98
0,0.5,0.98
5,0.5,0.98
4,1,0.98
0,0.35,0.98
0,0.15,0.98
2,0.5,0.98
0,0.5,0.98
7,0.5,0.98
5,1,0.98
0,0.35,0.98
0,0.15,0.98
12,0.5,0.98
9,0.5,0.98
5,0.5,0.98
4,0.5,0.98
2,1,0.98
10,0.35,0.98
10,0.15,0.98
9,0.5,0.98
5,0.5,0.98
7,0.5,0.98
5,0.5,0.98
```

If you copy and paste this into a file called `HappyBirthday.txt`, you can run:

```java
playFile("HappyBirthday.txt");
```

#### Hints
* If you have a String `s` of comma-separated values, then `s.split(",")` will return an array of Strings that are on either side of the commas. For instance, `"11,12,13".split(",")` will return the array `{"11", "12", "13"}`. You will then need to convert each to the correct type. The function `Integer.parseInt(string)` will convert a string to an integer, and the function `Double.parseDouble(string)` will convert a string to a double.
