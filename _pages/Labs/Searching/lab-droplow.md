      beginning: The algorithm fails on the test inputs due to one or more minor issues
      progressing: The algorithm is implemented to solve the problem correctly according to given test inputs, but would fail if executed in a general case due to a minor issue or omission in the algorithm design or implementation
      proficient: A reasonable algorithm is implemented to solve the problem which correctly solves the problem according to the given test inputs, and would be reasonably expected to solve the problem in the general case

In this lab, you will write and test functions to drop the lowest score in an `ArrayList<Double>` of test scores, and then return the average of the remaining items.

### Step 1: Searching the Array for the Smallest Item
First, linearly search the array to find the index of the smallest item.  Remove the lowest item from the array, and print it.  You can print an `ArrayList` by calling `.toString()` on the `ArrayList` variable, and printing that.  

### Step 2: Counting the Number of Iterations
In addition, count the number of times your loop iterates to find the smallest item.  You can use an `int` counter that you increment each time you execute the loop.  Following the loop, print out the count of the number of times you execute inside a loop.

Put all of the above code into a function, and you will call that function from `main()`. 

### Step 3: Calling This Function and Plotting Your Results
Within `main()`, call this function several times, each with a different sized array.  You will plot the number of steps that were needed against the size of the array.  You can use a loop with a random number generator to generate scores.  I suggest creating a function that generates and returns an `ArrayList<Double>`, in which you pass the desired size of the array as a function parameter.  The function then uses a random number generator to fill the array and return it.  Then, you can call this from `main()` within a loop, so that you try it multiple times without having to copy and paste your code!

To plot your results, you can copy or type the iteration counts you receive into Microsoft Excel and generate a line graph.  Your first column will be the size of the array that you used, and your second column will be the number of iterations that were required to find the smallest element in that array.  Thus, your x-axis will be the size of the array, and your y-axis will be the number of iterations.  What do you notice about the shape and direction of this graph?
