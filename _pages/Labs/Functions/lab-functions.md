In this lab, you will develop and use functions to modularize and re-use your code.  

## Background

Consider the [grading table of our course syllabus](../#grading).  It lists grading weights for each component of the course (for example, programming assignments).  To compute your course grade, you would first average all your programming assignment grades together, and all the other grade component averages.  To compute the assignment average <span>\\(\mu_{x}\\)</span>, take the sum of each of your <span>\\(n\\)</span> assignment scores <span>\\(x_{i}\\)</span>, and divide by the number of assignments, as follows:

<br><span>\\(\mu_{x} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}\\)</span><br>

For example, suppose your assignment grades are 100, 75, and 80.  Your average assignment grade is the equally-weighted average:

<div align="center">
<br><span>\((1.0 + 0.75 + 0.80) / 3 = ((1.0 * 0.333) + (0.75 * 0.333) + (0.80 * 0.333)) = 0.85\)</span> (or 85%)<br>
</div>

**Note that I converted each grade to a `double`; I did this by dividing each one by 100.0.  This ensures that I am using floating point division throughout my program, and not integer division, in my calculations!  I suggest you do this as well.  Before you `return` your result, you can multiply by 100.0 again so that your grade is on a scale from 0 to 100.**

Then, those averages are averaged - but not equally.  The weighted average is computed by multiplying each of your component averages by a weight <span>\\(w_{i}\\)</span>, given by the syllabus (for example, a 50% weight would be computed as 0.5 for that corresponding <span>\\(w_{i}\\)</span>):

<br><span>\\(\mu_{x} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} w_{i} x_{i}\\)</span><br>

This is actually the same as the standard equally-weighted average, where <span>\\(w_{i}\\)</span> is <span>\\(\frac{1}{n}\\)</span>, giving equal weight to all the components.

For example, suppose assignments had a weight of 40%, and labs had a weight of 60%.  If your overall assignment grade is an 80%, and your overall lab grade is a 90%, your grade formula would be:

<div align="center">
<br><span>\(0.4 \times 0.8 + 0.6 \times 0.9 = 0.32 + 0.54 = 0.86\)</span> (or 86%)<br>
</div>

## Part 1: Computing a Course Grade from a Weighted Average

In this lab, you will create a program that assigns variable values to labs, assignments, etc., according to the syllabus grade breakdown.  Then, you will compute your average lab grade, average assignment grade, etc., using equal weighted averaging (by adding up all the grades and dividing by the number of grades).  Then, you will take those computed averages, and compute a **weighted average** of them, using a weighted average (by multiplying each score by the weight of that score, and adding those products together).  You will print out your final grade.  

**You can make up grades for these as an example, and it is fine to only consider labs and assignments.  Use a 60% weight for assignments and a 40% weight for labs (these are not the actual weights in our course, but will be fine for an example!).**

It is nice to be able to compute these averages without having to do so by hand, but you probably noticed how tedious is was to copy and paste, or re-write, your averaging code over and over again!  We can use functions to reduce this workload.

### Computing an Equally-Weighted Average of Individual Grades
Write a function `computeEqualAverage` that returns a `double`, and accepts `double`s for your individual grades.  Modify your program so that you replace your equal-weight averaging with calls to this function.  Pass your individual grades as parameters to this function.  For this example, let's suppose you have three grades to compute (and, thus, three `double` parameters to this function).  This function adds up the grades and divides by the number of grades.

This function goes outside of your `main()` function, but inside of your class curly braces, and will look like this:

```java
public static double computeEqualAverage(double grade1, double grade2, double grade3) {
    // compute the average of grade1, grade2, grade3 here, and return that value
}
```

### Computing a Weighted Average of these Averages
Now, write a function `computeWeightedAverage` that also returns a `double`, and accepts `double`s for your course averages as well as the weights (since there is a lab average and an assignment average, and each has a weight, you should have four `double` parameters to this function).  This function multiplies each grade by its corresponding weight, and adds the resulting products together.

### Putting it all Together: Calling these Functions to Compute a Course Final Grade
Finally, write the body of your `main()` function to call the equal average function twice (once for assignments and once for labs), and then to pass those results as parameters to a call to the weight average function.  Specifically, you can call the `computeEqualAverage` function to obtain your assignment average and to obtain your lab average, and then call `computeWeightedAverage` to weight them.  For example, once your two functions (`computeEqualAverage` and `computeWeightedAverage`) are written, you could call them as follows:

```java
// suppose our assignment grades were 60, 90, and 80: you should get approximately 76.667 as the average
double assignmentAverage = computeEqualAverage(60, 90, 80); 

// suppose the lab grades were 80, 90, and 80: you should get approximately 83.333 as the average
double labAverage = computeEqualAverage(80, 90, 80); 

// the assignment weight is 60% and the lab weight is 40%.  You should get approximately 79.333 as the total grade.
double finalGrade = computeWeightedAverage(assignmentAverage, 0.6, labAverage, 0.4); 
```

## Extra Credit (10 Points): Merging the Averaging Functions into a Generalized Function
This program should be much shorter than if you had duplicated all the code to compute these averages!  However, there is still some redundancy.  The two average functions are still essentially the same algorithm and perhaps essentially the same code.

Write a function called `computeAverage` that returns a `double` and accepts the individual values as parameters, like the others.  This time, add individual `double` paramters for the weights.  Replace your call to `computeWeightedAverage` with a call to this function, passing the appropriate weights. 

Finally, replace your call to `computeEqualAverage` with a call to `computeAverage`, passing the appropriate weights there as well (what should the weights be when computing an equal-weight average?).

If you are only using assignments and labs for your averages, you will only have four values to pass to `comptueAverage` rather than 6.  You can pass zeroes for the extra two parameters, which will give the last zero a weight of 0, having no effect.
