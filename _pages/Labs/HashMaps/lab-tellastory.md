In this lab, you will use `HashMap`s to tell a dynamic story.  

## Part 1: The Story
Create a `HashMap` called `places` that define the different places you can go in your story.  These will map to a `String`.  The key `String` is the name of the place.  The second `String` (the value at that key) is a narration of your story upon entering that location.  Print this narration to the screen.

Create another `HashMap` called `moves` that gives a list of possible places one can go given the current room.  This will map to a value that is an array or an `ArrayList` of `String` values, each of which is a room key from the `places` array.  For example, `moves["courtyard"]` would contain the value `"classroom"` if one can go to the classroom from the courtyard.  `courtyard` and `classroom` should each be a key in `moves` and in `places`. Print out the list of keys and the names of those locations (you can look them up in the `HashMap`).  

You should have at least 5 possible rooms, and at least 3 of those rooms should have a choice of at least 2 possible next locations.

**Does your end room need a moves transition to other rooms?  Why or why not?  (You could map it to an empty array if you wanted).**

The user will enter the next location, and you will loop until reaching the `end` key.  Finally, include a hash entry for `start` and `end` from which your story will begin and end.  Use an appropriate loop structure to terminate the story when the `end` key is reached.

The following template will help you get started:

```java
    // Before you begin, put the following 1 line at the top of your program, under the "package" line
    // import java.util.HashMap
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // If Java gives you a "redundant type arguments" warning, you can ignore it!
        HashMap<String, String> places = new HashMap<String, String>();
        HashMap<String, String[]> moves = new HashMap<String, String[]>();

        // TODO: Create the list of rooms and narrations! 
        // (Keep the start room, and be sure to add an end room!)
        places.put("start", "You are in a large room.");
        places.put("middle", "You are in another room."); // you are welcome to change this, it's just an example!
        
        // TODO: What movements are possible between locations?  
        // Add an array here for each room!
        // There should be one key for every key in places above.
        // TODO: fix this to be a different set of rooms that you can move to, as you like.
        String[] startMoves = {"start", "middle"}; 
        moves.put("start", startMoves);
        
        // TODO: fix this to be a different set of rooms that you can move to, as you like.
        // my example "middle" room can move to the starting room or to the end room; 
        // ... again, this is just an example!
        String[] middleMoves = {"start", "end"}; 
        moves.put("middle", middleMoves);

        // Where are we starting the story?  (Leave this alone!)
        String currentRoom = "start";
        
        // TODO: write a loop that continues until currentRoom is "end"
        // What kind of loop do you need here?
        // TODO: print out each room's story narration, and a list of possible moves 
        // ... from that room
        // TODO: then, prompt the user and read a string (scanner.nextLine()) that 
        // ... will be the next room, and repeat for that room!
        // The room the user picks should be in the places.get(currentRoom) array,
        // ... so that only valid moves are made!
        
        // TODO: Don't forget to print the ending story message at the end!
        // ... after your currentRoom loop terminates
    }
```

Note that you should use a loop to scan over your keys to check which room you are in; that is, you should **not** have a separate `if` statement for every room that you are using!  Instead, you can use the `.get(key)` method of a `HashMap` variable to get the corresponding value.  For example:

```java
String story = places.get(currentRoom);      // gets the story associated with a room
String[] nextSteps = moves.get(currentRoom); // gets the set of next moves the user can take
```

**What happens if you call `places.get` with a room that doesn't exist in your program?**

### For Additional Context: Checking String Equality
To check if two `String`s are equal, you can do this:

```java
// if they're equal
if(str1.equals(str2)) {

}

// if they're not equal
if(!str1.equals(str2)) {

}
```

### For Additional Context: Printing an Array
You won't be able to `System.out.println` an array - so you'll need to print each item in a loop.  For example:

```java
// assuming you have a String[] possibleMoves array
// you will modify this for your own variables, of course!
for(int i = 0; i < possibleMoves.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(possibleMoves[i]);
}
```

## Part 2: Graphing Your Story Rooms and Move Transitions

**In your README, include a graph (either a drawing or in text is fine!) that shows the progression of your rooms from one to the next.**

## Extra Credit (Up to 15%): Best Story Competition
Creativity is encouraged, but not required for a grade!  Let me know in your documentation if you'd like to demo your story to the class - I hope you do!  You will receive 7.5% extra credit for entering your submission, and the class will vote on their favorite story (the winner will receive an additional 7.5% extra credit).

## Extra Credit (10%): Conditional Rooms
Modify your program to have conditionals, in which your rooms print certain things depending on whether other conditions have been met.  For example, if you reach one room after visiting another, print something different in your story.

The `HashMap` does not tell you directly if you have visited a room - it just stores the data that goes with each room.  You can keep track of this in a number of ways: for example, with an integer that counts how many times you have visited a room.  Here's an example:

```java
// put this at the top of your program, 
// so that it initializes in the beginning of main()
int startRoomVisits = 0; 

// This goes in your loop, as you go from room to room!
if(currentRoom.equals("start")) {
    startRoomVisits = startRoomVisits + 1;
}
```

You can check these values inside your loop as well, and learn which room you have visited, and how many times you've been there (and what other rooms you've seen before).  If you have a lot of room, you might consider making an array or `HashMap` of these values to map them to the individual rooms for convenience!
