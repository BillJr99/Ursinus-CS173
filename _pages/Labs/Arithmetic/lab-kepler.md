[Kepler's Third Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler's_laws_of_planetary_motion#Third_law_of_Kepler) relates the orbital period of a body around another body.  Due to gravitational forces, bodies in space are attracted to one another; objects in orbit continuously attract one another, forming an orbital pattern that we can predict.   In this lab \[[^1]\], you will compute the orbital period of the planets around the sun, given each planet's mass and length of its semi-major axis (the semi-major axis is half the length of the longest chord across the orbital ellipse).

The formula relating the orbital period `T` of a planet to its mass `m` and semi-major axis length `a` is:

<span>\\(T = \sqrt{\frac{4 \pi^{2} a^{3}}{G(M + m)}}\\)</span>

There are constants used in this formula, with values (given below) that you can plug into your program.  To use them, you can declare a constant variable as follows:

```java
final double VARIABLE_NAME = 123.456
```

(note the use of the `final` keyword, which means that the assigned value cannot be changed, and the capital letters for the variable name, which quickly indicates to a programmer that the value is indeed a constant).

* <span>\\(M = 1.989 \times 10^{30} kg\\)</span> 
    * This is represented in Java as 1.989e30
* <span>\\(G = 6.6743015 \times 10^{-11} \frac{meters^{3}}{kg \times sec^{2}}\\)</span> 
    * This is represented in Java as 6.6743015e-11

The following table provides your inputs for the planetary mass and semi-major axis length, as well as an approximate length of the year on that planet in Earth Days (to help you check your output).  These are approximations, so your values might be a little different because we're rounding some values, but this should give you a rough idea of the values you'll get.

| Planet | m: Mass (kg) | a: Semi-major Axis Length (AU) | Approximate Length of Year (Earth Days) |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mercury | 3.285e23 | 0.38710 | 87.9693 |
| Venus | 4.867e24 | 0.72333 | 224.7008 |
| Earth | 5.972e24 | 1 | 365.2564 |
| Mars | 6.39e23 | 1.52366 | 686.9796 |
| Jupiter | 1.898e27 | 5.20336 | 4332.8201 |
| Saturn | 5.683e26 | 9.53707 | 10775.599 |
| Uranus | 8.681e25 | 19.1913 | 30687.153 |
| Neptune | 1.024e26 | 30.0690 | 60190.03 |
| Pluto  (a dwarf planet) | 1.309e22 | 39.4821 | 90600 |

Astronomical Units (AU) is a unit of measure approximately defined as the distance from the earth to the sun.  However, notice that the units in the constants above use meters.  In order to use the axis length value in your formula, you will need to convert the length from AU to meters.  One AU is approximately 149,597,870,700 meters, which we will represent as a double (since the value itself is larger than the maximum value of an `int`), so you can multiply the `AU` value in the table above by this value, as follows:

```java
final double metersPerAU = 1.49597870700e11;
double mercuryAU = 0.38710;
double mercuryMeters = mercuryAU * metersPerAU;
```

Similarly, the formula yields the orbital period in seconds.  In order to output the orbital period in years, you will need to convert it by dividing the number of seconds by the number of seconds in an Earth year.  

To take the square root of a number `x`, you can use the `Math.sqrt(x)` function, and to raise a number `x` to a power `p`, you can use the `Math.pow(x, p)` function.  The constant <span>\\(\pi\\)</span> is provided to you as `Math.PI`.  `Math.sqrt(x)` and `Math.pow(x, p)` accept and return values of type `double`, and, similarly, `Math.PI` is a `double`.  For example, the code snippet below computes the area of a circle with radius `6` (note, this code will not appear in your lab directly; it's just an example!):

```java
double r = 6.0;
double rSquared = Math.pow(r, 2);
double area = Math.PI * rSquared;
```

An another coding example (unrelated to the lab, but for reference), to compute the average of two numbers, you might first add the two numbers, and then multiply by `0.5` (or divide by `2.0`), as follows:

```java
int x = 6;
int y = 12;
double average = 0.5 * (x + y);
```

I strongly suggest computing the portions of this formula one item at a time, rather than implementing the entire formula as a single line of code.  Thus, I would compute the numerator separately from the denominator, then compute the square root of the quotient.  You might even compute the division first and then separately take the square root of it.  This keeps your code short and your arithmetic concise, and each of these makes your code easier to read, understand, and fix!

Similarly, when converting the resulting orbital period from seconds to years, I recommend dividing the orbital period by the product of the number of days in an Earth year times the number of hours in a day, times the number of minutes in an hour, times the number of seconds in a minute.  This will make your program easier to read and understand.

## What To Do

* First, begin by declaring a `final double` variable `M`, and setting it to the value `1.989e30`.
* Next, declare another `final double` variable `G`, with the value `6.6743015e-11`.
* Then, using the table above, declare `double` variables `m` and `a`, equal to the values in the table for one of the planets.  If you choose Venus, I suggest naming the variables `venusM` and `venusA`, so that you will know which ones are which later when computing the rest of the planetary orbits!
* Multiply `a` by `1.49597870700e11` to convert it from AU to meters.
* Implement Kepler's Formula to compute `T`, the orbital period in seconds.  I recommend computing each part of the formula as a separate variable to make the code easier to write (and to read!).  For example, you might create a variable whose value is `M + m` first, and then multiply that by `G`.  Another variable could hold the numerator, which you might set to `4` before multiplying itself by Math.PI squared, and multiply that again by a "cubed."  Then you can divide those two variables as a new variable, and take the square root of that resulting variable.  There are many correct ways of doing this, though, so you don't have to follow this plan exactly!  This is just one approach that you are welcome to use.
* Convert `T` from seconds to days by dividing by the number of seconds in a day.  If you'd like, you can do this by dividing by the number of seconds in a minute, then dividing that by the number of minutes in an hour, and then dividing that by the number of hours in a day.
* Print `T`, the orbital period in days.  You can check your work using the table above, which provides the approximate period in days for each planet.
* Repeat this process for the remaining planets, such that your program prints out all of the orbital periods when you run it.  For now, you can copy and paste your code and modify the variable values to do this, but we'll learn an easier way soon!
* Don't forget to comment your code to describe what you are doing using `//`, and write up a README describing what you have done to accompany your submission.  You can save your README file in your project directory.
