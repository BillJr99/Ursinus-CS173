In this lab, develop and use arrays to simplify your computation over collections of data, so that you do not need to know how many data elements you are working with in order to develop a generalized algorithm.  

Consider the [grading table of our course syllabus](../#grading).  It lists grading weights for each component of the course (for example, programming assignments).  To compute your course grade, you would first average all your programming assignment grades together, and all the other grade component averages.  To compute the assignment average <span>\\(\mu_{x}\\)</span>, take the sum of each of your <span>\\(n\\)</span> assignment scores <span>\\(x_{i}\\)</span>, and divide by the number of assignments, as follows:

<br><span>\\(\mu_{x} = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}{n} x_{i}}{n}\\)</span><br>

Then, those averages are averaged - but not equally.  The weighted average is computed by multiplying each of your component averages by a weight <span>\\(w_{i}\\)</span>, given by the syllabus (for example, a 50% weight would be computed as 0.5 for that corresponding <span>\\(w_{i}\\)</span>):

<br><span>\\(\mu_{x} = \sum\limits_{i=1}{n} w_{i} \times x_{i}\\)</span><br>

This is actually the same as the standard equally-weighted average, where <span>\\(w_{i}\\)</span> is <span>\\(\frac{1}{n}\\)</span>, giving equal weight to all the components.

Create a program that assigns variable values to labs, assignments, etc., according to the syllabus grade breakdown.  Compute your average lab grade, average assignment grade, etc., using equal weighted averaging.

Then, take those computed averages, and compute a **weighted average** of them, using the weights in the syllabus.  Print out your final grade.

It is nice to be able to compute these averages without having to do so by hand, but you probably noticed how tedious is was to copy and paste, or re-write, your averaging code over and over again!  We can use functions to reduce this workload.

## Part 1: Equal Averages
Write a function `computeEqualAverage` that returns a `double`, and accepts an array of `double` for your individual grades.  Modify your program so that you replace your equal-weight averaging with calls to this function.  Pass your individual grades as an array parameter to this function.

Each time you return an equal average (for example, the equal average of your lab grades, the equal average of your assignment grades, and so on), insert those into an array called `courseAverages` that you will pass to `computeWeightedAverage` later.  You can create an array of a certain size like this in your `main()` function, and each of these will hold the result of one of your calls to `computeEqualAverage`:

`double[] averages = new double[4];`

where you know up-front that you will store 4 averages (for example, assignments, labs, projects, and attendance).  You have to specify how many elements you are storing up-front for now (we will improve upon this again later!).

Each time you call `computeEqualAverage`, store the result in one of these elements (for example, `averages[0] = computeEqualAverage(grades);` where `grades` is a `double[]`, an array of `double` values representing your collection of individual grades: `double[] grades`).

You can create a pre-initialized array of grades like this:

```java
double[] assignmentGrades = {90, 100, 80};
double[] labGrades = {95, 100, 85};
```

You can pass each of these to calls to `computeEqualAverage`, and assign the result to each index of `averages`, for example:

```java
averages[0] = computeEqualAverage(assignmentGrades);
// ... and so on
```

## Part 2: Weighted Averages
Now, write a function `computeWeightedAverage` that also returns a `double`, and accepts an array of `double` for your course averages, and an additional array of `double` to represent the weights.  Call this function passing the average array and a weights array as parameters.
