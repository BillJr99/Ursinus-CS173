  goals:
    - To demonstrate the fundamental concepts of programming in a unified project
    - To work effectively as a member of a small group using collaborative tools for software development
  rubric:
    - weight: 40
      description: Algorithm Implementation
      preemerging: The algorithm fails on the test inputs due to major issues, or the program fails to compile and/or run
      beginning: The algorithm fails on the test inputs due to one or more minor issues
      progressing: The algorithm is implemented to solve the problem correctly according to given test inputs, but would fail if executed in a general case due to a minor issue or omission in the algorithm design or implementation
      proficient: A reasonable algorithm is implemented to solve the problem which correctly solves the problem according to the given test inputs, and would be reasonably expected to solve the problem in the general case
    - weight: 20
      description: Test Cases
      preemerging: Testing was performed outside of the unit test framework, or not performed at all
      beginning: Trivial test cases are provided in a unit test framework
      progressing: Test cases that cover some, but not all, boundary cases and branches of the program are provided
      proficient: Test cases that cover all boundary cases and branches of the program are provided
    - weight: 20
      description: Code Quality and Documentation
      preemerging: Code commenting and structure are absent, or code structure departs significantly from best practice, and/or the code departs significantly from the style guide
      beginning: Code commenting and structure is limited in ways that reduce the readability of the program, and/or there are minor departures from the style guide
      progressing: Code documentation is present that re-states the explicit code definitions, and/or code is written that mostly adheres to the style guide
      proficient: Code is documented at non-trivial points in a manner that enhances the readability of the program, and code is written according to the style guide
    - weight: 10
      description: Presentation
      preemerging: No presentation was provided, the presentation could not be viewed, or the presentation was not on the subject of the final project
      beginning: A presentation was provided that summarizes the project, but does not provide a demo or discuss broader impacts
      progressing: A presentation was provided that summarizes the project, provides a demo, and discusses broader impacts
      proficient: A presentation was provided that that summarizes the project, provides a demo, discusses broader impacts, and highlights challenges overcome and methodologies for developing the system as a group
    - weight: 10
      description: Writeup and Submission
      preemerging: An incomplete submission is provided
      beginning: The program is submitted, but not according to the directions in one or more ways (for example, because it is lacking a readme writeup)
      progressing: The program is submitted according to the directions with a minor omission or correction needed
      proficient: The program is submitted according to the directions, including a readme writeup describing the solution

In this project, you will propose a topic of your choosing and a group of at least 2 and up to 3 total members.  The project must be approved by the instructor before it may commence, but the topic is entirely up to you.  Multidisciplinary projects with a broader impact are encouraged, and you are welcome to collaborate with a stakeholder outside the department for inspiration on potential projects (this person is not to contribute code, only disciplinary context).

You will use git or another version control system to coordinate between your team.  

Finally, prepare as a team a project presentation using a screencast (such as [Screencast-O-Matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/)) that you will share with the class for final presentations.  Alternatively, you may choose to present to a live class audience, as time permits.
