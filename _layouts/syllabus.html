    Drop-In / office hours are certainly available for asking questions about the course, about your assignments, and other academic questions you may have.  You do not need an appointment to come to drop-in hours, and you do not even need to have an agenda or set questions!  You can come and just have a general chat about things with us.  If you cannot make it to drop-in hours, you can contact us for an appointment as well.  Drop-In hours are also for non-instructional topics of conversation: you can talk with me about your adjustments to college life, your long-term goals, advice about your academic journey, and most other things.  If I don't know the answer to something or if I don't feel I am the best person to offer you advice about it, I will be happy to help connect you with the right people.  In other words, don't be afraid to ask me things that you think are "off topic" - I love teaching because I love to be a resource for you on your journey.  I'll be happy to see you there.

    <h2>Grade Breakdown</h2>
    Letter grades will be assigned on the scale below at the end of the course. "Grade grubbing" is not conducive to professional practice; every assignment has or will have very precise expectations and point breakdowns, and I will evaluate submitted work carefully according to these standards. I will also return assignments in a timely manner, and the running weighted grades will be updated frequently. Therefore, I expect a commensurate level of respect from you. In sum, you should know where you stand at all times, there will be plenty of opportunities to improve your standing, and there should be no surprises at the end of the course.

    <!--<p>-->
    </div> 
 
    <a name="environment"></a> 
    <h3>Classroom Environment and Inclusivity Standards</h3>    
    My goal is to foster a environment in which students across all axes of diversity feel welcome and valued, both by me and by their peers. Axes of diversity include, but are not limited to, age, background, beliefs, race, ethnicity, gender/gender identity/gender expression (please feel free to tell me in person or over e-mail which pronouns I should use), national origin, religious affiliation, and sexual orientation. Discrimination of any form will not be tolerated.
    
    Furthermore, I want all students to feel comfortable expressing their opinions or confusion at any point in the course, as long as they do so respectfully. As I will stress over and over, being confused is an important part of the process of learning computer science. Therefore, I will not tolerate any form of put-downs by one student towards another about their confusion or progress in the class. Learning computer science and struggling to grow is not <a href="https://i0.wp.com/katielmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/1_9HzbByi2Uzit8474Rp4ZPg-1.jpg?w=550&ssl=1">always comfortable</a>, but I want it to feel safe.  Much of this material is probably new to everyone, and those with some prior experience likely recall a time when it was new to them, too.  Remember that <strong>this is not a competition</strong>: helping others to grow is itself a richly rewarding professional development opportunity.  
    
    In order to allow for equitable access to class for students who may be attend and participating remotely, I may record our class sessions. These recordings will only be available on our Canvas site. I will announce that we are recording in the beginning of any classes of this kind; out of respect and privacy for me and all class members, please do not download, copy, or redistribute class recordings.
    
    
    
    
    <h3>Online Communication Policy</h3>
    Since this is a class-wide communication, the following rules apply to message groups and electronic communications:
    <ol>
    <li>Students are expected to be respectful and mindful of the <a href="#environment">classroom environment and inclusivity standards</a>.</li>
    <li>They are equally applicable to a virtual environment as they are in class.</li>
    <li>Students are not permitted to share direct answers or questions which might completely give away answers to any homework problems or labs publicly on Microsoft Teams. When in doubt, please send me a direct message there.</li>
    <li>I will attempt to answer questions real time during my virtual drop-in / office hours. Otherwise, I will make every attempt to respond within 24 hours. Of course, students can and should still respond to each other outside of these intervals, when appropriate!</li>
    <li>Students may ask anonymous questions.</li>
    </ol>
       
    
    
    {% if layout.boilerplate.lms.title and layout.boilerplate.lms.description %}
    <h3>Course Management Systems: {{layout.boilerplate.lms.title}}</h3>
    {{layout.boilerplate.lms.description}}
    <br /><br />
    Since it is likely that students will have similar questions, it is much more efficient for me to answer them there so the whole class can see the answer, so it is possible that I will ask you to re-send a question publicly that I get in an e-mail.  If you'd prefer, I could anonymize the question as well, but I'd like you to have the opportunity to post it so that you are credited with having such a good question!
    {% endif %}
    
    
    <a name="collaboration"></a>
    <h3>Collaboration Policy and Academic Integrity Policy</h3>
    Communication between students is allowed (and encouraged!), but it is expected that every student's code or writeups will be completely distinct! Please do not copy code off of the Internet (repurposing code from the Internet will probably make it harder anyway because the assignments are so specialized). Please cite any sources in addition to materials linked from the course website that you used to help in crafting your code and completing the assignment.
    <br /><br />
    See the <a href="{{layout.boilerplate.links.handbook}}">Course Management</a> page in the Faculty Handbook for an explanation of college policies on plagiarism and other academic honesty violations.
    <br /><br />
    To encourage collaboration, students will be allowed to choose one "<strong>buddy</strong>" to work "near" during the assignment. Students are still expected to submit their own solutions, but they are allowed to provide substantial help to their designated buddy, and even to look at the buddy's code during the process. Students must indicate their buddies in the README upon assignment submission. Please let me know if you would like a buddy but are having trouble finding one.
    <br /><br />
    Below is a table spelling out in more detail when and how you are allowed to share code with people (table style cribbed from <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring19/cos126/syllabus.html">Princeton CS 126</a>).
    <br /><br />
    <strong>Please Note:</strong> The terms "exposing" and "viewing" exclude sending or ingesting electronically, which would be considered copying. Exposing and viewing are normally done in the context of in-person working or in the help room.  In addition, "Other People" includes internet sources!

    If the work you submit appears to be copied from previous work or the collaboration policy has been violated in any way (including working with more collaborators or "buddies" than the course deliverable specifies) according to the College <a href="{{layout.boilerplate.links.academichonesty}}">Academic Honesty</a> policy, regardless of intent, then it may be an academic dishonesty case, and it will be referred to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs.  I am required to make this report in every occurrence, so it is best to speak with me first if there are any questions about the policy or expectations.  You should feel free to have these conversations with me anytime prior to making your submission without fear of penalty.
    
    Finally, aside from the collaboration policy here, it is expected that your work is your original work.  You must cite any collaborations or references that you use.  You may have a friend or relative with computing experience, but they should not do your assignments, labs, etc., for you.

    <h3>Flexible Submission Policy</h3>
    {{ page.info.flexible_submission_policy }}
    {% endif %}
    
    
    <h3>Incomplete Policy</h3>
    A grade of <strong>I</strong> may only be granted by permission of the Office of the Dean.  A petition to the Office of the Dean will only be made upon written request by the student, including all information requested by the Office of the Dean.  Requests for a grade of <strong>I</strong> will only be made in situations where such a request is warranted.  Specifically, the student's grade must be passing at the time the request is made.
    
    
    
    <h3>Title IX</h3>
    Title IX is a federal law, under which it is prohibited to discriminate, harass, or commit misconduct on the basis of gender or sex.  The <a href="{{layout.boilerplate.links.titleix}}">Title IX Coordinator</a> is available to receive inquiries and to investigate allegations in this regard.  
    
    
    
    <h3>Inclement Weather and Class Cancellation Policy</h3>
    In the event that the College closes due to inclement weather or other circumstances, our in-person class sessions, drop-in / office hours, labs, or other meetings will not be held.  I will contact you regarding our plan with regard to rescheduling the class or the material, any assignments that are outstanding, and how we can move forward with the material (for example, any readings or remote discussions that we can apply).  If necessary, I may schedule online virtual sessions in lieu of class sessions, and will contact you with information about how to participate in those.  I will communicate this plan to the department so that it can be posted on my office door if it is feasible to do so.  This policy and procedure will also apply in the event that the College remains open but travel conditions are hazardous or not otherwise conducive to holding class as normal.  Should another exigent circumstance arise (for example, illness), I will follow this policy and procedure as well.
    
    
    {% if layout.boilerplate.miscpolicies %}
    <h3>Miscellaneous Policies</h3>
    <ul>
    {% for policy in layout.boilerplate.miscpolicies %}

    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endif %}
    
    
    <h3>Student Perception of Teaching Questionnaire (SPTQ)</h3>
    I will be soliciting student feedback through the SPTQ and possibly through other forms of commentary.  This feedback greatly assists me and the department as we develop our courses and overall curriculum for this program.  This course has benefitted from the feedback of those students who took the course before you, and your feedback will help maintain and improve the course for those to follow.  I strongly encourage you to participate in this important and valuable process.
    
    
    <h3>Syllabus Subject to Change</h3>
    I will do my best to provide all relevant information about the course on this syllabus.  Sometimes, exigent circumstances, the pace of the class, or other circumstances will warrant minor revisions to the syllabus.  For example, inclement weather or other campus closure might affect the course schedule and assignment deadlines; in addition, I may find that the class benefits from spending more time on a particular topic, and adjust accordingly.  Although I try to avoid rescheduling drop-in / office hours, it may become necessary from time to time to accommodate other events in the College.  Should any revisions be necessary, I commit to making any revisions in my estimation of the best interests of the class, and commit to communicating those changes to you as soon as I make them.
