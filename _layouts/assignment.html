    Please answer the following questions in your README file before you begin writing your program.
    
    <ol>

    In your submission, please include answers to any questions asked on the assignment page in your README file.  If you wrote code as part of this assignment, please describe your design, approach, and implementation in your README file as well.  Finally, include answers to the following questions:
    
    <ul>
    <li>Describe what you did, how you did it, what challenges you encountered, and how you solved them.</li>
    <li>Please answer any questions found throughout the narrative of this assignment.</li>
    <li>If collaboration with a buddy was permitted, did you work with a buddy on this assignment? If so, who?  If not, do you certify that this submission represents your own original work?</li>
    <li>Please identify any and all portions of your submission that were not originally written by you (for example, code originally written by your buddy, or anything taken or adapted from a non-classroom resource).  It is always OK to use your textbook and instructor notes; however, you are certifying that any portions not designated as coming from an outside person or source are your own original work.</li>
    <li>Approximately how many hours it took you to finish this assignment (I will not judge you for this at all...I am simply using it to gauge if the assignments are too easy or hard)?</li>
    <li>Your overall impression of the assignment. Did you love it, hate it, or were you neutral? One word answers are fine, but if you have any suggestions for the future let me know.</li>
    <li>Any other concerns that you have. For instance, if you have a bug that you were unable to solve but you made progress, write that here. The more you articulate the problem the more partial credit you will receive (it is fine to leave this blank).</li>
    </ul>
